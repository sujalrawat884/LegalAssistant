He has investment in the shares and securities issued by Indian companies, which are long term investments held in the Demat accounts in question. Such investments were intended to have the benefit of funds, as per his retirement. One of the investments the petitioner made was in a company, which appears to have been promoted in the year 1989 by his father-in-law namely Shrenuj & Company Limited (for short ""Shrenuj""). The petitioner subscribed 2000 shares of Shrenuj in the year 1989 and thereafter 1000 shares in the year 1993. By way of a sub-division (1:5) in the year 2005, the petitioner's shareholding in Shrenuj increased to 15,000 and further by bonus shares in the proportion of 1:2 issued in the year 2014, which made the petitioner's shareholding at 30,000 shares.

These are two petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The reliefs prayed for are quite similar, which pertain to challenging the action of the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange under the directives of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to freeze the Demat Accounts of the Petitioner. The first Petition No.1590 of 2021 is filed by Dr. Pradeep Mehta and the second Petition (Writ Petition No.2228 of 2021) is filed by his son Neil Pradeep Mehta. We proceed to adjudicate each of these Petition as under. Writ Petition No.1590 of 2021 (Dr. Pradeep Mehta v/s. Union of India).

It is stated that the background for this being in March 2017, the petitioner, when received his monthly statement of accounts, found that some of his shares in his demat account maintained with the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (for short ""SHCIL"") were frozen. The case of the petitioner is that the NSDL by communications dated 23 March 2017 and 13 April 2017 freezed the demat account of the petitioner applying Circular No.CIR/CFD/CMD/12/2015 dated 30 November 2015 and Circular No. SEBI/HOCFD/CMD/CIR/P/2016/116 dated October 26, 2016.

The company was further advised to refer to Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD/12/2015 dated 30 November 2015 issued by the SEBI.

A reply affidavit on behalf of respondent no. 3-BSE of Ms. Arpita Joshi, Manager is filed.

It is stated that the petitioner's demat account being frozen on account of non- compliance with the provisions of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations for two consecutive quarters by Shrenuj.

It is stated that under section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short ""SEBI Act""), SEBI has wide powers to protect the interests of the investors in securities and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market. These powers inter alia include the power to specify the requirements for listing and transfer of securities as provided under Section 11A of the SEBI Act. It is further stated that in terms of section 30 of the SEBI Act and section 31 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (for short ""SCR Act""), SEBI has power to make regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act. It is next stated that SEBI thus exercises powers to protect the investors' interests and make regulations consistent with the provisions of the SEBI Act and that similar to Section 31 of the SCR Act, Section 31 of the SEBI Act provides every regulation made by SEBI under the SEBI Act to be laid, as soon as after it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for thirty days. If both Houses agree that any regulation should not be made or should be made in a modified form, such modification or annulment has to be followed.",,"13. It is contended by the petitioner that on 2 June 2018, BSE issued a public notice published in the daily newspaper ""Financial Express""

notifying the delisting of several companies including Shrenuj with effect from 4 July, 2018. In pursuance thereto, on 4 July 2018, SEBI delisted Shrenuj as per the public notice. NSE also issued a further notice dated 27 July 2018 to delist Shrenuj with effect from 8 August 2018. As a consequence of such delisting, the petitioner's demat accounts were wholly frozen. Consequent thereto Respondent no. 6-NSDL issued a letter dated 8 August 2018 informing the petitioner of freezing of his demat account as 'suspended for debits'.","sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt requirements of Section 15A are satisfied for levy of such penalty.

Such amount of penalty is not being taken in the Consolidated Fund of India but as income as GST and TDS are deducted. It is submitted that such action on the part of the SEBI is, in fact, as good as a scam as in such manner large amounts of money are being collected, in a manner not recognized by law and not credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.","9. The petitioner also addressed a detailed letter dated 4 January 2018 to the SEBI stating that he was never in any direct or indirect control of Shrenuj, and that he never held any post in the company; that he was unaware of the company having allegedly violated the (LODR) Regulations. He further stated that he was named as an investor promoter of Shrenuj and company at the time of its incorporation in the year 1989 and that he had never been a director of the company or involved in any of its day to day affairs. He stated that no notice or an opportunity of a hearing was given to him before freezing his shares.

It is stated that under sub-section (2) of Section 11A of the SEBI Act, SEBI may specify the requirements of listing and transfer of securities or other incidental matters. Prior to SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015, the listing obligations and disclosure requirements were governed by the listing agreements entered into between a company which intended to be listed on the stock exchanges. Clause 39 of such Listing Agreements entered between the companies intending to get listed and the Stock Exchange(s) provided that such Company would agree that in the event of the application for listing being granted, such listing shall be subject to the Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of the Exchange which are in force at the time of entering into the agreement or thereafter.

On the other hand, learned Counsel for the SEBI has relied on the reply affidavit to justify the impugned action referring to the provisions of the SEBI Act, SCR Act and the regulations framed thereunder as referred to in the reply affidavit.

The impugned action is taken after about 29 years of the petitioner being declared to be the promoter. It appears that except for the fact that in 1989 when Shrenuj was incorporated when the petitioner was set out to be a promoter, the petitioner had no association whatsoever with Shrenuj, subsequent to the formation of the said company. The Petitioner had remained as an ordinary shareholder of Shrenuj qua his limited shareholding. He was never a director of the company. He was never involved with the company, in any other capacity, in managing the affairs of the company. Such specific case of the petitioner appears to have gone unchallenged. Shrenuj suffered losses. It had also defaulted in complying with certain regulations as issued by the SEBI under the provisions of the SEBI Act and regulations sometime in the year 2016, at which point of time, status of the petitioner was nothing but merely of a shareholder of the company. It would be appropriate to note the default of Shrenuj as informed to Shrenuj by the Bombay Stock Exchange by its letter dated 2 March 2017 imposing a penalty/fine on Shrenuj for non-compliance of the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations. Such non-compliance of which is being held against the petitioner to freeze the petitioner's demat accounts, so as to recover the penalty/fine from the petitioner. The said letter reads thus:

(2) While holding an inquiry the adjudicating officer shall have power to summon and enforce the attendance of any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case to give evidence or to produce any document which, in the opinion of the adjudicating officer, may be useful for or relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry and if, on such inquiry, he is satisfied that the person has failed to comply with the provisions of any of the sections specified in sub- section (1), he may impose such penalty as he thinks fit in accordance with the provisions of any of those sections. (3) The Board may call for and examine the record of any proceedings under this section and if it considers that the order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interests of the securities market, it may, after making or causing to be made such inquiry as it deems necessary, pass an order enhancing the quantum of penalty, if the circumstances of the case so justify:

Provided that no such order shall be passed unless the person concerned has been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter:

It is hence, the petitioner's submission that the compliance of all the obligations under the SEBI Act and the regulations made thereunder was the obligation of the company as managed by its Board of Directors.

Certainly, no obligation of this nature appears to have been crystallized in a manner known to law qua the petitioner. Thus, such obligation cannot be fastened on the petitioner by an action of freezing the petitioner's demat accounts. If such an obligation is to be enforced, there are several facts which would be required to be taken into consideration to determine the role of the person whether he is the promoter at the relevant time considering the relevant facts and in the real sense as the law would mandate. Thus, reference of the respondents to the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 appears to be an exercise in total futility."

The determination of a person's status as a promoter is contingent upon his actual involvement in the formation of the company which is a question of fact.

These provisions also become significant as it is a contention as urged on behalf of SEBI that the petitioner's demat account is freezed as a penalty for non-compliance of the regulations by the company. It is also SEBI's contention that it is of no consequence whether the petitioner is part of the management of Shrenuj as the same is not the criteria for 5 (1996) 2 SCC 471,,"(2) The manner of revocation of actions specified in clauses

The petitioner has contended that his father is a practicing gynecologist with about 40 years of practice and even if he was to be branded as a 'promoter' of Shrenuj, merely because of his investments into his father in law's company as a shareholder, his father was never a promoter or director of the listed entity.

,,,,"51. The provisions of the SEBI (Delisting of Equity shares )Regulations 2009 also need to be noted which reads thus :-
""23. Rights of public shareholders in case of a compulsory delisting:
(1) Where equity shares of a company are delisted by a recognised stock exchange under this Chapter, the recognised stock exchange shall appoint an independent valuer or valuers who shall determine the fair value of the delisted equity shares. (2) The recognised stock exchange shall form a panel of expert valuers from whom the valuer or valuers shall be appointed for purposes of sub-regulation (1).

,,,,"52. On a plain reading of the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act as noted above, we do not find any explicit provisions that the SEBI would have a power to attach the demat account of the promoter much less qua the securities he would hold of companies other than the one of which he is a promoter. Further, none of the provisions postulate such drastic order to be passed against the promoter which is in the nature of a penalty without even a notice being furnished to him. Further, on a perusal of Regulation 98(1)(c) & (d) of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015, it clearly provides that listed entity or any other person thereof, who contravenes any of the provisions of the regulations, shall be held liable by the respective stock exchange(s) for actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, ""freezing of promoter/promoter group holding"", of designated securities, as may be applicable, in coordination with depositories or any other action as may be specified by the Board from time to time. Clause (2) of regulation 98 provides that the manner of revocation of actions specified in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-regulation (1), shall be as specified in circulars or guidelines issued by the Board.",,,,"54. We may also observe that the SEBI's contention referring to Regulation 98 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, being applicable so as to justify the freezing of the petitioner's demat account also cannot be accepted. This for the reason that we are not shown any primary obligation as fixed on the promoters and that too at a stage after almost 29 years of the formation of the company (Shrenuj), that the promoter nonetheless, would have certain obligations to be discharged under the Act and/or the Regulations. In our opinion, unless such basic obligation is statutorily fastened on the promoter, Regulation 98 cannot be applied in vacuum and moreso considering the facts and circumstances of the present case.
",,,"(v) Having regard to our discussion and conclusion, we keep open all issues of law on the challenge raised by the petitioner to the legality of the statutory regulations."
,,,,"55. The object of SEBI (LODR) Regulation primarily concerns the listing obligations and a disclosure requirement to be complied by a company. In the present case, the company was formed in the year 1989, and after all statutory compliances, it was listed on the Bombay Stock",,,,"sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt Exchange. We are not shown any material that the petitioner did not cease to have any role, after the company was formed and/or till it defaulted under the said Regulation although it was managed by the Board of Directors. None of the respondents have showed any active role of the petitioner in the capacity of the promoter, in the management of the company and any role and obligation factually fastened on the petitioner in the various compliance which are required to be undertaken under the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, at the time of the freezing of his demat accounts. It is, therefore, difficult to accept that the listing obligations as postulated under the SEBI (LODR) Regulations were at all applicable qua the petitioner, so as to apply Regulation 98(1)(c) in freezing the demat account of the petitioner. We may observe that in the circumstances in hand when a basic obligation under the Regulations itself is not conferred on the promoter of the nature petitioner is, there could not have been a corresponding duty and a consequent default, attributable for any action to be taken under Regulation 98.
",,,(vi) The petition stands allowed in the aforesaid terms.
,,,,"56. As we are dealing with the freezing of the demat accounts of the promoter, it would be relevant to consider the definition of the word 'promoter' as defined under clause (za) of Regulation 2 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 which is extracted hereunder:

-------------------------
sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt ""(za) ""promoter"" includes:
(i) the person or persons who are in control of the issuer;
(ii) the person or persons who are instrumental in the formulation of a plan or programme pursuant to which specified securities are offered to public;
(iii) the person or persons named in the offer document as promoters:
Provided that a director or officer of the issuer or a person, if acting as such merely in his professional capacity, shall not be deemed as a promoter:
Provided further that a financial institution, scheduled bank, foreign portfolio investor other than Category III foreign portfolio investor and mutual fund shall not be deemed to be a promoter merely by virtue of the fact that ten per cent. or more of the equity share capital of the issuer is held by such person;
Provided further that such financial institution, scheduled bank and foreign portfolio investor other than Category III foreign portfolio investor shall be treated as promoter for the subsidiaries or companies promoted by them or for the mutual fund sponsored by them.""",,,,".... The status of a promoter is generally terminated when the Board of directors has been formed and they start governing the company.""
",,,Writ Petition No. 2228 of 2021 (Neil Pradeep Mehta vs. UOI & Ors.)
,,,,"57. It would also be necessary to examine the definition of ""promoter"" as defined in the Companies Act, 2013, which read thus:

2(69) ""promoter"" means a person --
(a) who has been named as such in a prospectus or is identified by the company in the annual return referred to in section 92; or
(b) who has control over the affairs of the company, directly or indirectly whether as a shareholder, director or otherwise; or
(c) in accordance with whose advice, directions or instructions the Board of Directors of the company is accustomed to act:
Provided that nothing in sub-clause (c) shall apply to a person who is acting merely in a professional capacity;
(emphasis supplied)
-------------------------
sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt",,,,"63. We are of the opinion that the above principles would necessarily apply when any action under the SEBI Act or Regulations framed thereunder is being taken against any promoter. This would necessarily involve robust evidence to be available and considered in regard to the role of the promoter not only qua the company but also whether any active role of the promoter exists qua the shareholders at large and whether the fiduciary capacity in which the promoter is required to discharge his role in formation of a company, would still bind him for various compliances, under the SEBI Regulations or it would be the liability of the company managed by the Board of Directors for achieving all the compliances, which are necessary to protect the interest of the investors who subscribe to the shares of a company. If there is no consideration and examination of such essential attributes before taking any action against the promoters, it would certainly lead to a serious prejudice and / or even a gross absurdity, rendering any action of penalty or freezing of any demat account of a promoter, as in the present case to be grossly arbitrary and illegal.
",,,"88. In this petition, the petitioner is the son of Dr. Pradeep Mehta, the petitioner in the aforesaid Writ Petition, whose petition has been allowed in terms of our aforesaid judgment/order."
,,,,"58. Thus, clause (a) of Section 2(69) of the Companies Act, 2013 refers to a de jure position, where a person is expressly named in a prospectus or is identified by the company as a promoter in the annual return referred to in Section 92. Clause (b) and (c) describes a de facto position where a promoter is a person who has control over the affairs of the company, directly or indirectly, whether as a shareholder, director or otherwise; clause (c) provides that the Board of Directors of the company is accustomed to act in accordance with the advice, directions or instructions of such person. Proviso to section 2(69) (supra) ordains that the provisions of sub-clause (c) shall not apply to a person who is acting merely in a professional capacity.",,,,"Now, what are the facts here? As I have indicated the question of promotion only applies to the first respondent. It is said that he must be deemed to have taken part in the formation of the Company and to be a promoter because he signed the Memorandum and Articles of Association and subscribed for 100 shares. There is no evidence showing that he took any part in discussing the formation of the Company or in taking any steps to bring the Company into being, apart from the fact that he signed the Memorandum of Association and paid for 100 shares. It is not even suggested that he had anything to do with the drawing up of the Memorandum and Articles of Association. There is no suggestion that the first respondent had anything to do with the selection of the Directors or the settlement of any contract, except the contract under which his firm was to act as brokers. After the Company had been formed and had started business the first respondent's firm induced certain people to subscribe for shares, but it is not alleged that they did anything before the Company was launched. The minimum subscription was fixed at 500 shares and the signatories to the Memorandum of Association themselves subscribed for 1200 shares . In the Memorandum of Association the only persons referred to as promoters are V.K. Lakshmana Mudaliar and J.W. Samuel. It comes to this. The Court is asked to hold the first respondent to be a promoter because his signature appears at the foot of the Memorandum and he took 100 shares of the 1200 initially subscribed. This is a contention which I am unable to accept. The law requires that there shall be seven signatories to the Memorandum of Association of a public Company. A person who

It cannot take a recourse to what was the position when the company was formed, i.e., in the year 1989. It was necessary for the SEBI/NSDL to look into the last return as filed by the company which in the present case would be of the year 2014 to 2016 which is of the period just prior to the default by Shrenuj.

It was mentioned in the course of the argument that the money subscribed by the first respondent for his 100 shares was utilised in defraying part of the expenses of forming the Company. That may be, but it was a matter which concerned the directors. The application of the money which the first respondent paid for his shares was a matter over which he had no control, and the fact that the money was utilised in paying the expenses of formation, cannot make him a promoter. The agreement with the respondents was an agreement which conscientious directors ought never to have entered into and in doing so the directors deliberately exceeded their powers. But this, of course, has nothing to do with the question whether the first respondent is to be deemed to be a person who took part in the formation and promotion of the Company. For the reasons indicated it must he held that the Official Liquidator was not entitled to take out a summons against the first respondent on the ground that he was a promoter.""

,,,,"60. We may also examine the role of promoter insofar as the company law is concerned. In such context, we may usefully refer to the views of the learned author A. Ramaiya in his celebrated work ""Guide to the Companies Act"" 18th Ed. Vol. 1, when on the role of the promoter, is described as under :-

The term is not one of law but familiar to the business world. It points to a person who forms a company and gets it going. It indicates 'a person who originates the scheme for the formation of the company, has the Memorandum and Articles prepared, executed and registered, and finds the first directors, settles the term of the preliminary contracts and prospectus (if any) and makes arrangement for advertising and circulating the prospectus and placing the capital, is emphatically a promoter in the fullest sense'. He controls the formation and future of the company, and it is this control which lies at the root of the fiduciary relation of the promoter to the company. Nor is he less a promoter if all or most of these activities are performed nominally by a company which he controls.
.......
The question whether a person is or is not a promoter is a question of fact, depending upon what he really did in connection with the formation of the company. [ Lydney and Wigpool Iron Ore Co. v. Bird, (1886) 33 Ch D 85] .......
A person cannot become a promoter merely because he signed the memorandum as a subscriber for one or more shares.[ Official Liquidator v. VeluMudaliar, (1938) 8 Com Cases 7 : AIR 1938 Mad 192] ....But persons who act in a professional capacity such as counsels, solicitors, accountants, engineers or other technicians, will not become promoters by reason of so acting, unless they exceed their professional function and do anything or take any interest in promoting the company.

The relationship between the promoter and the company that he has floated must be deemed to be a fiduciary relationship from the day the work of floating the company started CIT v. Bijli Cotton Mills Ltd., (1953) 23 Com Cases 114, 120 : AIR 1953 All 232 and continued upto the time that the directors take into their hands what remains to be done in the way of forming the company, Twycross v. Grant, (1877) 2 CPD 469, 541 (CA) and when there is no question open between the promoter and the company Eden v. Rids Dales Rly. Lamp & Lighting Co. Ltd, (1889) 23 QBD 368 (CA).",,,,"65. Thus, applying such settled position in the context of the present case, the petitioner, a practicing gyneacologist, did not exceed his professional position, to take interest in the formation of Shrenuj or to promote or manage its day-to-day affairs. Also, after the incorporation of the company and constitution of the Board of Directors, the status and role of the petitioner as a promoter had come to an end. Hence, the obligation of non-submission of Financial Results and non-compliance with the provisions of SEBI (LODR) Regulations could not have been fastened and imposed on the petitioner.

The petitioner is a non-resident Indian currently residing in Singapore. He is also an angel investor investing in promising start-ups in India. In 2014, petitioner opened a NRO account and a demat account through HDFC Bank Ltd. and for logistical reasons of a local address and mobile number, the bank suggested adding the petitioner's father - Dr. Pradeep Mehta as a second holder to his Demat account."

The observations of Lindley, L.J. which are of signifcance in the context of the role of the promoter qua a company read thus:

""Moreover, to say that James Bird was a promoter of the company and therefore liable to account to it, is calculated to mislead; for the word 'promoter' is ambiguous, and it is necessary to ascertain in each case what the so-called promoter really did before his legal liabilities can be accurately ascertained, and that in every case it is better to look at the facts and ascertain and describe them as they are.""

1. In terms of section 21A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCR Act) read with rule 21 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 and Chapter V of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 (""Delisting Regulations""), a recognised stock exchange may compulsorily delist the equity shares of a listed company on certain grounds.

There is another facet which also needs to be commented that the freezing of the petitioner's demat account as set out in the reply affidavit filed on behalf of SEBI, is regarded inter alia to be in the nature of a penalty/fine, as also seen from the letter dated 2 March 2017 (supra), addressed by the BSE to Shrenuj, and it is for defalut of Shrenuj, the petitioner is being penalised by the impugned action. Insofar as the applicability of the principles of law is concerned, it would not make much difference as to whether what is sought to be recovered from the petitioner is penalty or fine. The reason for this being that a penalty would include fine. A categorical stand is taken on behalf of the SEBI/BSE that a penalty / fine being imposed on Shrenuj is sought to be recovered by the impugned action of the freezing of the petitioner's demat account. It would be appropriate to note the jurisprudential meaning attributed to the terms 'penalty' and 'fine' and in the present context. We may usefully refer to the following extract from Advanced Law Lexicon of P. Ramanatha Aiyar, 3rd Edition, when the learned author distinguished fine from penalty.

""DISTINGUISHED FROM ""penalty"". In its broadest sense ""penalty"" includes fines, as well as all other kinds of punishment. (Esselink v. Campbell, 4 lowa. 296.)

The petitioner has certainly suffered such illegality and for a long period of six years, which has prevented him from operating his demat account and dealing with the shares held by him other than of Shrenuj. The petitioner has categorically averred that looking at his age, the funds were to be utilized by him for his retirement. We would not expect any person to suffer in such manner and that too in a high-handed and arbitrary manner as in the present case. As noted hereinabove, we are of the clear opinion that BSE/NSE as also SEBI has clearly failed to discharge their duties and to act in accordance with law so as to deprive the petitioner of his shares in the demat account held by him which certainly, in our opinion, is an infringement of petitioner's right guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 300A of the Constitution. Any casual approach to such infringement certainly would not be an acceptable approach and in fact would strengthen the hands of these authorities to repeat such illegalities. In fact if we fail to impose costs, it would amount to putting a premium on such illegality of these respondents. In these circumstances, although we are not inclined to grant an amount of Rs.2 crores as compensation / cost in favour of the petitioner, we are inclined to award an amount of Rs.30 lakhs to be paid to the petitioner by BSE/NSE/SEBI, which shall be jointly paid.

We are not shown any specific power as conferred on the SEBI under the SEBI Act which would confer any authority to freeze the demat account of the promoter qua the shares held by him of a company other than of the defaulting company of which he is a promoter or any other office bearer.

It cannot be overlooked that section 15A of the SEBI Act provides for a penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. and the amount of penalty it prescribes at different amounts as set out in clause (a), (b) and (c).

On the said reply being received by the petitioner from BSE, the petitioner addressed a detailed letter dated 21 April 2021 to the SEBI stating that he was never a promoter or director in the delisted entity and the fact that freezing power itself is illegal and goes against the basic statute of Companies Act.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the record on this petition. There is much substance in the contentions as urged on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned action in the present case crosses all boundaries of legitimacy, reasonableness, fairness, being the principles the statutory bodies like SEBI, BSE and NSE are required to adher being governed by statutes and regulations. We say so as in the present case ex-facie there were no reasons whatsoever, to freeze the petitioner's demat account which came to be freezed merely because the petitioner's father happens to be a second holder of his demat account. The petitioner in this case was never the promoter of Shrenuj. When the petition was filed, the petitioner was 39 years of age and when Shrenuj was promoted in the year 1989, the petitioner was 7 years of age, when his father Dr. Pradeep Mehta was styled as one of the promoters of Shrenuj.

""66. It was argued, based on rulings relating to natural jus- tice, that unless civil consequences ensued, hearing was not nec- essary. A civil right being adversely affected is a sine qua non for the invocation of the audi alteram partem rule. This submission was supported by observations in Ram Gopal [Ram Gopal Chaturvedi v. State of M.P., (1969) 2 SCC 240 : (1970) 1 SCR 472], Col. Sinha [Union of India v. Col. J.N. Sinha, (1970) 2 SCC 458 : (1971) 1 SCR 791] . Of course, we agree that if only spiritual censure is the penalty, temporal laws may not take cog- nizance of such consequences since human law operates in the material field although its vitality vicariously depends on its morality. But what is a civil consequence, let us ask ourselves, by- passing verbal booby-traps? 'Civil consequences' undoubtedly cover infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and non-pecuniary damages. In its comprehensive connotation, everything that affects a citi- zen in his civil life inflicts a civil consequence. ""Civil"" is defined by Black (Law Dictionary, 4th Edn.) at p. 311:
""Ordinarily, pertaining or appropriate to a member of a civitas of free political community; natural or proper to a citizen. Also, relating to the community, or to the policy and govern- ment of the citizens and subjects of a state.
The word is derived from the Latin civilis, a citizen .... In law, it has various significations.
*** 'Civil Rights' are such as belong to every citizen of the State or country, or, in a wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organisation or administration of Govern- ment. They include the rights of property, marriage, protec- tion by the laws, freedom of contract, trial by jury etc.... Or, as otherwise defined, civil rights are rights appertaining to a per- son in virtue of his citizenship in a State or community. Rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action. Also a term applied to certain rights secured to citizens of the United States by the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, and by various acts of Congress made in pur- suance thereof.
6 AIR 1978 SC 851.",,,,"100. In our opinion, the present case is more gross and is a classic example of high-handed action and a reckless action to freeze the demat account of the petitioner. There is patent non-application of mind by any of these authorities, who are statutorily governed in resorting to take such drastic action. This apart, even the elementary principles of natural justice of a fair opportunity of calling upon the petitioner to show cause, a hearing and appropriate order to be passed have been thrown to the winds. This is certainly not the manner or method in which the rule of law would mandate these respondents to act.

The most valuable right in a democratic polity is the ""little man's"" little pencil-marking, assenting or dissenting, called his vote. A democratic right, if denied, inflicts civil consequences. Likewise, the little man's right, in a representative system of Gov- ernment, to rise to Prime Ministership or Presidentship by use of the right to be candidate, cannot be wished away by calling it of no civil moment. It civics mean anything to a self-governing citi- zenry, if participatory democracy is not to be scuttled by the law, we shall not be captivated by catchwords. The straight forward conclusion is that every Indian has a right to elect and be elected and this is a constitutional as distinguished from a common law right and is entitled to cognizance by courts subject to statutory regulation. We may also notice the further refinement urged that a right accrues to a candidate only when he is declared returned and until then it is incipient, inchoate and intangible for legal as- sertion -- in the twilight zone of expectancy, as it were. This too, in our view, is logicid sophistry. Our system of ""ordered"" rights cannot disclaim cognizance of orderly processes as the right means to a right end. Our jurisprudence is not so jejune as to ig- nore the concern with means as with the end, with the journey as with the destination. Every candidate, to put it cryptically, has an interest or right to fair and free and legally run election. To draw lots and decide who wins, if announced as the electoral method- ology, affects his right, apart from his luckless rejection at the end. A vested interest in the prescribed process is a processual right, actionable if breached, the Constitution permitting. What is inchoate, viewed from the end, may be complete, viewed mid- stream. It is a subtle fallacy to confuse between the two. Victory is still an expectation; qua mado is a right to the statutory proce- dure. The appellant has a right to have the election conducted not according to humour or hubris but according to law and jus- tice. And so natural justice cannot be stumped out on this score. In the region of public law locus standi and person aggrieved, right and interest have a broader import. But, in the present case, the Election Commission contends that a hearing has been given although the appellant retorts that a vacuous meeting where nothing was disclosed and he was summarily told off would be strange electoral justice. We express no opinion on the factum or adequacy of the hearing but hold that where a candidate has reached the end of the battle and the whole poll is upset, he has a right to notice and to be heard, the quantum and quality being conditioned by the concatenation of circumstances.""",,,,"101.

""32. .........It is now a settled principle of law that the rule of audi alteram partem applies to administrative actions, apart from judicial and quasi-judicial functions. It is also a settled position in administrative law that it is mandatory to provide for an opportunity of being heard when an administrative action results in civil consequences to a person or entity.
33. In State of Orissa v. Dr (Miss) Binapani Dei, a two-judge bench of this Court held that every authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action has a duty to give a reasonable opportunity to be heard. This Court further held that an administrative action which involves civil consequences must be made consistent with the rules of natural justice:
""9. [...] The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set-up that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the State or its officers. Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed: it need not be shown to be super-added. If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person, duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power. If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person is made, the order is a nullity. That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case.""
34. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, a seven-judge bench of this court held that any person prejudicially affected by a decision of the authority entailing civil consequences must be given an opportunity of being heard. This has been reiterated in a catena of decisions of this Court. In view of the settled position of law, the next question that arises before us is the scope and definition of the phrase 'civil consequences'.

There is not a semblance of reason for such action to be taken against the petitioner. We may also observe that the actions and cundect of the BSE / NSE and SEBI as the law mandates is to protect the interest of the investors. In the present case these statutory bodies have totally acted contratry to such norms. In fact the impugned actions of these respondents when taken against a person like the petitioner is also likely to shake the confidence of investors who are non residents Indian. This is certainly not what can be expected from the conduct of these entities. The duty to safeguard the investor's sentiments and confidence is paramount which stand breached in every possible manner in the present case.

In that case, the Court held that denial of a democratic right to cast a vote inflicts civil consequences. In D K Yadav v. J M A Industries, a three-judge bench of this Court observed that ""everything that affects a citizen in his civil life inflicts a civil consequence.""

36. In Canara Bank v. V K Awasthy, a two-judge bench of this Court succinctly summarized the history, scope, and application of the principles of natural justice to administrative actions involving civil consequences in the following terms:

""14. Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years. Rules of natural justice are not rules embodied always expressly in a statute or in rules framed thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute. What particular rule of natural justice should be implied and what its context should be in a given case must depend to a great extent on the fact and circumstances of that case, the framework of the statute under which the enquiry is held. The old distinction between a judicial act and an administrative act has withered away. Even an administrative order which involves civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The expression ""civil consequences"" encompasses infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything that affects a citizen in his civil life.""",,,,,,,

Thus, the depository is taking an action at the behest of the Stock Exchanges and in compliance of the requirements of the SEBI under the provisions of the SEBI Act and SEBI (LODR) Regulations.

Section 19F provides for penalty for failure to comply with directions issued by Board under Section 19 of the Act. Section 19G provides for penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.

Section 19-I provides for factors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.

The recovery can also be in terms of what has been provided under Section 19F which necessarily attracts the provisions of Section 19H in regard to adjudication.

i) That the SCR Act, 1956 is enacted to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein and by providing for matters connected therewith. It inter alia makes provisions for recognition of stock exchanges, contracts and options in securities, listing of securities and for penalties and procedure. Section 9 which provides for power of recognized stock exchanges to make bye-laws, is relied on behalf of the respondents and more particularly Section 9(2)(o), which provides that the stock exchange would be empowered to make bye-laws in regard to levy and recovery of fees, fines and penalties.
