1,"Imax Corporation vs E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt. Limited ... on 24 October, 2024","1. The Petitioner- IMAX Corporation (for short ""IMAX"") , a Canadian Corporation, claiming to be the world's leading entertainment technology company, specializing in motion picture technology and large format motion picture presentations, having its registered office at 2525 Speakman Drive, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, holding three Awards in its favour, pursuant to the arbitration proceedings, being concluded between it and E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt. Ltd. (Respondent No.1) before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in London, has approached this Court, by filing the present Arbitration Petition, invoking Section 47, 48 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short ""the Act of 1996""), seeking a declaration that the three Arbitral Awards in its favour, are enforceable under the provisions of Part II of the Act.",IMAX also seek directions to enforce and execute the Arbitral Awards as decrees in its favour and against all the Respondents.,"IMAX, a Canadian Corporation, was incorporated as a Federal Company on 11/09/1967 with its Executive Offices, located in New York City, which stake a claim that it is one of the world's leading entertainment companies, engaged in the business of large format projection and sound systems , with 5/168 CARBP-414-18.odt its specilization in motion picture technology. The business of the IMAX include the sale or lease of large format projection and sound systems to other companies in various parts of the world.",,"Respondent No.1- E-City Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. is represented by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Prateek Seksaria , whereas, Respondent Nos.2 and 3 are represented by Mr. Navroz Seervai, the learned Senior Counsel, who has raised a preliminary objection about maintainability of the Petition qua Respondent Nos.2 and 3, who, according to him, are neither the parties to the Arbitration Agreement or to the Award and I will he dealing with it in due course of my analysis of the counter arguments.","Pending the enforcement and/or execution of the Arbitral Award, directions are sought against the Respondents to disclose on oath forthwith or within such time as this Court 3/168 CARBP-414-18.odt deems fit, the details of the movable and immovable properties owned by the Respondents as well as the particulars about the shares, debentures, bonds, securities etc. alongwith the debts due and payable by any third party as well as the details of bank accounts, stock in trade, cash in hand etc.","2. IMAX has filed the present proceedings in the backdrop that it is almost more than a decade, E-City has been attempting to avoid confirmation of Arbitral Awards in India, though the Awards have already received confirmation in Canada and its primary concern is, the interim period, is in fact adding an advantage to the Respondent Nos.2 to 4, who are alleged to have fraudulently stripped assets from E-city Entertainment, in an attempt to prevent IMAX from recovering the amount due to it under the Awards and the premise on which the Petition rest is, there is no valid reason not to recognize the three Awards in its favour. It is a stand adopted that, since the grounds to challenge a foreign Arbitration Award under Section 48 of the Act of 1996 are limited and none of the factor could evade the recognition and enforcement of the Awards in India, as they have been already declared to be fair and proper, after full court hearing in the Superior Court of Ontario, Canada, which has confirmed them, through a valid Judgment.",,c) The present Petition is in essence a Petition challenging the demerger scheme which is not permissible;,
,,4. I have collated the background facts from the arguments advanced on behalf of the respective counsels and as set out in the Arbitration Petition as well as the Affidavits filed on behalf of the Respondents and I deem it appropriate to cull out the sequence of events before I proceed to appreciate the rival contentions advanced and I have tried to be brief in compiling the necessary facts.,"A direction is also sought against the Respondents to deposit the decretal amount of sum of U.S. $ 11,309,496.06 plus interest at the rate of U.S. $ 2,512.60 per day from 01/10/2007 till payment and realization, with liberty to IMAX to withdraw the same.","I will be referring to the relevant clauses of this Agreement, as I deal with the contest, as the bone of contention between the Parties has its genesis in it.",,"Respondent No.4, E-City Investments and Holdings, is represented by learned senior counsel Mr. Sharan Jagtiani.","20. Focusing on his second objection, Mr.Seksaria would submit that since the Petitioner had admittedly filed separate application seeking execution only against Respondent No.1, which is pending, the present Petition to the extent that it seek reliefs which are in the nature of execution, are untenable under Section 47-49 of the Act of 1996 as it is his contention that in the said Application , the Respondent has a right to raise all such objections, which are permissible to be raised under the Code of Civil Procedure and this right cannot be taken away just by filing a Petition under Section 47-49 from restricting it to the grounds under Section 48 or by the mere recognition of an Award or by legal fiction, 'Being deemed to be Decree of this Court'.","on 28/09/2000 for lease of 6 (six) IMAX® systems by IMAX and the Final Letter Agreement reflecting the arrangement worked out, to open and develop upto 20 IMAX® systems, as it set out the commitments, the lease terms and also comprises a clause for confidentiality.",,"As a sequel to the above, the present petition in my view is barred by limitation and the argument of Mr. Seksaria on behalf of Respondent No.1, and entertaining the petition would also be hit by the public policy of India, being not to entertain the proceedings barred by the law of limitation.",
,,"IMAX Limited was incorporated as an Ontario Corporation, a sole shareholder of IMAX Corporation on 14/12/1998.","It is the claim of IMAX that the agreed interest was part of the final Award and the amount owed to IMAX is now in excess of US $ 20,860,000.00.","In the wake of aforesaid breach, IMAX invoked the dispute resolution provision of the Master Agreement, which provided for all disputes to be decided by arbitration, as per the International Chamber of Commerce rules. The arbitration was held in London before a distinguished panel of Arbitrators : Arthur Marriott, Q.C. of the then International Law Firm of Dewey Leboeuf, Professor Errol Mendes of the University of Toronto, Canada and M.L. Bhakta of the Mumbai Law Firm of Kanga & Company.",,Both parties participated in the Arbitration process through their counsel and filed pleadings and evidence and series of hearings were held in London before the Arbitral Tribunal.,"Further, according to the learned senior counsel , clause 14 of the Agreement, expressly stipulated that the transaction is contingent upon approval from RBI and as it contemplated payment of the non refundable deposit of USD 300,000 towards initial rent, the nontransferable trademark license fee, consultancy fees etc. and each of the remittances entailed prior approval of RBI/Government of India on account of the then applicable RBI Notification dated 03/05/2000 under FEMA and Rules of 2000.","6. It is the specific case of the Petitioner that after the Final Letter Agreement in form of Master Agreement was signed between the Parties, the Promoter of Essel Group went to New York to renegotiate the Master Agreement, but abruptly E-City Entertainment informed IMAX that it no longer intended to perform its obligations under the Master Agreement and an Email from the Assistant of Dr. Chandra informed IMAX that Essel Group unilaterally decided to breach the Agreement by communicating as below :-

""With time passing by and certain external forces taking toll, investment priorities for the Essel Group underwent a massive restructuring process and unfortunately, IMAX theatre investments was something that we could not prioritize, especially in light of its uncertainty for return on investment.
8/168 CARBP-414-18.odt [A]t this point in time, E-City is not in a position to make investments in IMAX theatres in India as priorities lie in building multiplex theatres, which is a part of the larger strategy of the Essel Group of getting into film products, distribution and then exhibition through E- City, thereby tapping all areas in the entire value chain related to films in the Indian market.""",,"Since Reserve Bank of India, is the central Authority responsible for its administration , the violations of FEMA is looked at with seriousness and it may lead to fines upto three times the amount involved and in severe cases, the imprisonment.",
,,"Respondent No.1-E-City Entertainment is a Company incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 1956, having its registered offence in the address mentioned in the title clause, in Mumbai. Respondent Nos.2 to 4 in the proceedings are the Essel Group Companies having their respective offices and place of business as indicated in the title clause and it is the specific contention of IMAX that the Respondents are the Companies within the Essel Group, which is a conglomerate, which owns and controls many companies and assets, including the E-City Entertainment. It is alleged that the conglomerate referring its companies as ""our companies""","3. I have heard the learned counsel Mr. Aspi Chinoy for IMAX Corporation, who has placed before me the list of dates 4/168 CARBP-414-18.odt and events in the backdrop of which he want the issues raised in the Petition filed under Section 47, 48 and 49 of the Act of 1996, to be looked into, for grant of reliefs, as prayed therein.","On 10/06/2013, the Notice of Motion was allowed and the learned Single Judge of this Court, concluded that Part I of the Act of 1996 is applicable to the case and it is permissible to challenge the Foreign Award, by invoking Section 34 of the Act of 1996 and hence all the provisions of Part I of the Act are applicable and the Petition under Section 34, is maintainable in India.",,I shall now briefly refer to the arguments advanced on behalf of the respective counsel for the contesting parties.,"26/168 CARBP-414-18.odt When IMAX issued a notice of termination of exclusivity to Respondent No.1 and asserted that they were at liberty to pursue sale and/or lease of IMAX systems, and notice of default was issued by it, and in the statement of defence, E- City adopted a specific stand that the terms of the Agreement contemplated that it was contingent upon E-City receiving RBI approval.","due to the common control and management of all the Respondents. In view of the same, the corporate veil should be lifted and all of the Respondent companies should be treated as one concern and the Petitioner should be enabled to claim on that basis. In order to safeguard the interest of IMAX, it is requested to pass order and/or a declaration that the three Arbitral Awards - the Liability Award dated 09.02.2016, the Quantum Award dated 24.08.2007 and the Final Award dated 27.03.2008 are enforceable under the provisions of the Part II of the Arbitration Act and directions to be issued to enforce and execute the said Arbitral 18/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Awards as a decree in favor of the Petitioner and against all the Respondents.""",,"In arriving at a conclusion that the award was unenforceable under Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act, and while dealing with main objection for enforceability of the award being; NAFED was unable to comply with the contractual obligations to export due to Government's refusal; the question arose, whether enforcement of the award is against the public policy.",
,,"organizes them into 8 categories viz. Media, Technology, Entertainment, Packaging, Infrastructure, Education, Precious Metals and Healthy Lifestyles and Wellness.","At the incipience, I must introduce the parties to the Petition.","Therefore, there is no doubt that Part-I has no application because the parties chose and agreed to the arbitration being conducted outside India and the arbitration was in fact held outside India.""",,"Mr.Chinoy, on behalf of the Petitioner, has thus justified the recognition and enforcement of the three foreign awards as deemed decrees against Respondent No.1, under which an amount in excess of US $ 25.80 million is payable to the Petitioner.","25. Mr.Seervai, the learned senior counsel representing Respondent Nos.2 and 3, has assertively raised a preliminary objection about the impleadment of Respondent No.2, E-City Real Estates Private Limited and Respondent No.3, E-City Projects Construction Pvt. Ltd., on the ground that they are neither party to the contract nor they were party to the arbitration proceedings and finally on the ground that they are not even party to the award.

Relying upon this decision, Mr.Seervai has submitted that Chamber Summons was taken out for deletion of Respondent Nos.2 and 3.

","In the liability Award passed by ICC in favour of IMAX, E-city's submission on RBI approval was noted by the Tribunal and in its declaratory Award it specifically noted that there was no hint or suggestion in the letters that it was other than a deal done, but according to Mr.Seksaria, the Tribunal rendered a finding against it, however, in Statement of Defence in the post liability phase also E-City reiterated its stand that it was obliged under Foreign Investment Laws to obtain approval of RBI as per Clause 14 of the Agreement and no such approval was received, despite request and a specific stand was adopted that the execution and/or implementation of any Lease Agreement would have been illegal and unenforceable under the law of the place of performance, viz. India and, therefore, unenforceable as a matter of Singapore Law being the law applicable.",,"114. In the wake of the observations made to the above effect, I am convinced to accept the objection raised by E-City about the award not being enforceable, as it is in contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law, since no permission of RBI was received and, therefore, no remittance was allowed, which resulted into a notice of default issued by the Petitioner on 17/05/2004.",
,,"The Essel Group controls media companies under the brand name of ""ZEE"" through ZEE TV as well as other group companies including E-City Entertainment.","8. In the sequence of events, it is noted that E-City Entertainment, on 23/07/2008 filed Arbitration Petition (L) No.525/2008 under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, raising a challenge to all the three Awards before this Court under Part I of the Act of 1996. It also took out an Application seeking 10/168 CARBP-414-18.odt condonation of delay of 20 days and sought permission to institute the proceedings for setting aside of the Awards.","11. Learned senior Counsel Mr.Aspi Chinoy has specifically impressed on the fact that the Arbitral Awards have already been confirmed by the Canadian Court and the resulting Canadian Judgment has been accepted as a New York Judgment, as he would submit that on 24/06/2011 IMAX had instituted proceedings in Superior Court of Ontario (Canadian Court) seeking recognition of the Awards and declaring them to be enforceable as Ontario Judgment under the applicable laws of Canada. According to him, the request was opposed by E-City Entertainment by marking its appearance before the Canadian Court and upon an extensive briefing, pre-trial discovery and a Court hearing before superior Court in Toranto, Canada, on 02/12/2011, the Canadian Court declared its decision confirming the Arbitration Awards and converting them into Canadian Judgment in favour of IMAX. It is pertinently pointed out, that while doing so the Court rejected E-City Entertainment's arguments that the Awards were not proper and enforceable. The Canadian Judgment was then recognized and converted into a valid United States Judgment by an order of the New York Supreme Court on 09/10/2015 with the following conclusion :-

""Ordered that IMAX Corporation's petition, seeking an order pursuant to CPLR $ 5225 (b) directing respondents The Essel Group, Subhash Chandra, Atul Goel, Amit Goenka, Laxmi Goel, ZEE TV USA, Inc., Asia TV USA Ltd., and Natural Wellness USA, Inc. to deliver sufficient funds to satisfy the judgment, or directing respondents to deliver their personal property to the Sheriff of the county of New York to satisfy the judgment, and directing respondents to render an accounting of their corporate assets is denied.
This constitutes the decision, order and judgment of the court.""",,"16. The learned senior counsel Mr.Prateek Seksaria representing E-City Entertainment, Respondent No.1, has raised three prominent points in opposing the relief sought in the Petition and for countering the submission advanced by Mr.Chinoy and his submissions can be disintegrated as below :-

a] The Petition is ex-facie barred by the Law of Limitation under Article 137 of Schedule 1 of the Limitation Act, 1973.
b] Section 47-49 of the Act of 1996, contemplate a two stage process viz. u/s 47 a Party applying for enforcement is required to produce evidence at the time of making application, whereas, Section 49 stipulate a legal fiction, where if the Court is satisfied that a foreign Award is enforceable, the Award is deemed to be a Decree of the Court, whereas, Section 48 deal with recognition of a Foreign Award. Therefore, Section 47-49 do not contemplate execution proceedings under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure (""CPC"" for short), which is not relatable to Section 47-49. In the present case, the Petitioner has admittedly filed a separate Application seeking execution under Order 21 Rule 11 of the CPC, being numbered as Commercial Execution Application No.49/2017 only against Respondent No.1 on 29/03/2017 and it is pending till 19/168 CARBP-414-18.odt date, being conscious that leave under Order 21 Rule 22 of the CPC is necessary before proceeding to execute the foreign Award, with the legal fiction of it being executable as Decree of the Court. In the Execution Application, a specific order is passed to the effect that the Execution Application and Chamber Summons filed by the Judgment Debtors will have to await the outcome of Arbitration Petition No.414 of 2018.
c] The transaction contemplated under the Master Agreement is violative of RBI Notification dated 03/05/2000 under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (""FEMA""), the Foreign Exchange Management (Current Accounts Transaction) Rules, 2000 and is violative of public policy of India and, therefore, the Awards are unenforceable under Section 48 (2) of the Act of 1996.
d] In absence of an appropriate notice being given to Respondent No.1 of the appointment of the the Arbitral Tribunal as also the Arbitral proceedings, the recognition and enforcement of the Award should be refused under Section 48(1)(b) of the Act of 1996 and also under Section 48(1)(d) of the Act as the composition of the Arbitral Authority and the procedure followed by the Arbitral Tribunal was contrary to and not in accordance with the Agreement of the parties i.e. Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (applicable with effect from 01/01/1998).
e] The suppression and false statement made by the Petitioner that the Petitioner was unaware of the demerger scheme when it approached the Court in Ontario for recognition of the Foreign Award.","26. One another point on which Mr.Seervai has focused his attention, in contesting the claim in the Petition is, as regards the attack on the demerger orders, which according to him, are passed by the court of competent jurisdiction and it is his contention that the Petitioner is attempting to raise a collateral challenge to the order of demerger passed by the competent Court and this is not a permissible course of action, since IMAX has sought to assail the demerger orders, by submitting that it is not required to challenge the said orders 14 (2022) 1 Supreme Court Cases 753 31/168 CARBP-414-18.odt to sustain a tracing action in respect of assets of E-City Entertainment, that have been alleged to be transferred to the Respondent Nos.2 and 3.","24. In addition, Mr. Seksaria has also stressed upon another leg of public policy being ""fair hearing"" and it is his contention that a party, in an adversery system is required to challenge in cross-examination the evidence of any witness of opposing party, if he wishes to submit to the court that evidence should not be accepted on that point, which is a matter of fairness and 10 (2020) 19 SCC 260 11 (2021) 19 SCC 629 28/168 CARBP-414-18.odt this ensure that the witness is given an opportunity to explain his or her evidence if is to be so impugned.",,121/168 CARBP-414-18.odt,
,,"Respondent No.1-E-City Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. is alleged to be a Company of the Essel Group, whose shares are held and controlled by one Dr.Subhash Chandra, Promoter of the Group alongwith his brothers and the family members.","9. IMAX challenged this interim order dated 10/06/2023 before the Apex Court by filing Civil Appeal No.3885/2017, when the finding rendered by the learned Single Judge came to be reversed, thereby dismissing the Petition filed by E-City Entertainment under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. The Apex Court recorded its finding as below :

""31. The significant determinant in each case is the agreement of the parties as to the place of arbitration and where in fact the arbitration took place. If in pursuance of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration took place outside India, there is a clear exclusion of Part-I of the Arbitration Act. In the present case, the parties expressly agreed that the arbitration will be conducted according to the ICC Rules of Arbitration and left the place of arbitration to be chosen by the ICC. The ICC in fact, chose London as the seat of arbitration after consulting the parties. The arbitration was held in London without demur from any of the parties. All the awards i.e. the two partial final awards, and the third final award, were made in London and communicated to the parties. We find that this is a clear case of the exclusion of Part-I vide Eitzen Bulk A/S (supra), and the decisions referred to an followed therein.
32. The respondent contends before us that Part-I of the award was applicable, however they themselves stated the place of arbitration to be London.
It is pertinent to reproduce the relevant portion in the respondent's application before the ICC while objecting to the authority of the law firms representing the appellant. It stated :-
""The seat of this arbitration is London.""
11/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Therefore, the two reasons for Part-I not being applicable are as follows :-
(i) Parties agreed that the seat may be outside India as may be fixed by the ICC; and
(ii) It was admitted that the seat of arbitration was London and the award was made there.","12. Mr.Chinoy while pressing the relief in the present Petition for recognition and enforcement of the Arbitral Award has justified the impleadment of Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4 by advancing his submission, that Respondent No.1, in the midst of arbitration, began to divest the assets of E-City Entertainment in an unlawful manner, with a design to prevent IMAX from recovering the expected damages to be awarded and he would accuse E-City Entertainment of acting in breach of the provisions of Section 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956, by failing to give the Petitioner notice of the demerger process, which could have enabled the Petitioner to appear before the Court and raise an objection, but this opportunity was denied to IMAX.
I will be dealing with this point and the response of Mr. Seervai to the said submissions at the appropriate stage.",,"17. In support of his submission that the Petition is barred under Article 137 of Schedule 1 of the Limitation Act, 20/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Mr.Seksaria has urged, that the Declaratory Award was passed by the ICC Tribunal on 09/02/2006 and the partial Final Award on jurisdiction and quantum is dated 24/08/2007, whereas the Final Award is passed on 27/03/2008.","29. Mr.Sharan Jagtiani, learned senior counsel, representing Respondent No.4, a company incorporated on 29/09/2000 with its primary objective being to invest, hold and acquire shares and other securities in other companies, with Respondent Nos.1 to 3 being some of such companies, has also opposed the Petition, with reliefs sought therein.","According to the learned senior counsel, in absence of a direct challenge to the demerger orders, it is not open to IMAX to chase the assets that stood transferred to the Respondents with the imprimatur of the Company Court and that too on some unsubstantiated ground that the demerger was fraudulent. It is also clarified that in the wake of the demerger orders, the assets that stood transferred to the Respondents also carried with it respective liabilities and this submission is the heart of his case.",,"122/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Reply statement of Mr.David Berman(on behalf of IMAX Corporation) is also to be noted, where he admitted as below :-",
,,6/168 CARBP-414-18.odt,"10. E-City Entertainment/Respondent No.1 on 27/11/2014 instituted Suit No.300/2015 and filed Notice of Motion No.1112/2016 against IMAX, inter alia, seeking damages and permanent injunction from taking action to enforce the Arbitral Award in New York Court.","13. It is also the argument of Mr. Chinoy that it is now a well settled position of law, that in case of a foreign award, the award holder is entitled to apply for recognition of the Award and seek its enforcement/execution as a decree by filing a common petition. He would place reliance upon the decision of the Apex Court in case of Government of India Vs.Vedanta Limited & Ors.1 and in particular, the relevant observation to the effect that the proceedings seeking recognition and enforcement of a foreign award has different stages; in first stage the Court would decide about enforceability of the Award having regard to the requirement of Section 47 and 48 of the Act of 1996, but once it is so decided, it would proceed to take further effective steps for execution of the Award and if the 1 (2020) 10 SCC 1 14/168 CARBP-414-18.odt desired object and purpose can be served in the same proceedings, there is no need to take two separate proceedings, as it would result in multiplicity of the proceedings.
Relying upon the said decision, it is the submission of Mr. Chinoy that recognition of Award is required to be first decided as against E-City Corporation i.e. Respondent no.1 and once the Court decides that it is enforceable, it shall be deemed to be a decree of the Court against Respondent No.1 and the Court shall take effective steps for its execution.
At this juncture, Mr.Chinoy clarify that Respondent Nos.2 to 4 are not joined in the Petition as Judgment-Debtors under Award, but they are impleaded as Respondents for execution/effective enforcement of the Award/Decree against Respondent No.1, who is accused of transferring the assets and properties in favour of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in a systematic manner, so as to divest E-City Entertainment of its assets during the continuation of the Arbitration proceedings, by using the device of the Scheme of demerger. He has, therefore, urged that this is a fit case where corporate veil of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 shall be lifted and execution be permitted against them, as they are holding the improperly divested properties of Respondent No.1.
He would place reliance upon the decision of Division Bench of this court in case of Bhatia Industries & Infrastructure Limited Vs. Asian Natural Resources (India) Ltd. & Vitol S.A.2 to buttress his submission that the doctrine of piercing corporate veil is also applicable in execution 2 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 10695 15/168 CARBP-414-18.odt proceedings, when the Court from the material on record arrive at a conclusion that the Judgment-Debtor is trying to defeat the execution of the Award passed against him and he would submit that the the frontiers of the doctrine of lifting of corporate veil are unlimited and it must be applied depending upon the realities of the situation, as it aim at doing justice to the parties and the horizon of this doctrine is definitely expanding in the modern scenario.",,"The learned counsel would recall the decision of the Apex Court in case of S.Nagaraj & Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.7, to support his submission that the fundamental principle is, that justice is above law and the Court is not precluded from recalling its own order even suo motu or rectifying the error, if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so.","This Court, according to Mr.Jagtiani, dismissed the Chamber Summons, by concluding that the Respondents 19 2020 SCC Onlline Bom 217 39/168 CARBP-414-18.odt sought to be added, not being parties to the foreign arbitration proceedings and/or foreign award, the Chamber Summons appeared to evade the provision, as they were not parties as envisaged under Section 48 of the said Act, as the foreign award was enforceable only against the Judgment Debtor, who was the party to the arbitration agreement and against whom the award was passed and the foreign award cannot be enforced against the additional Respondents, who are neither parties to the arbitration agreement nor to the award.","27. Being extremely critical about the stand adopted by IMAX, that demerger is a ""sham"" and by referring it as ""conspiracy"", he would respond by submitting that these words are not to be used as magic mantras or catch-all phrase, to defeat or nullify the effect of a legal situation and in absence of sufficiency of grounds, it is not open for IMAX to claim that the demerger orders are nullity in order to visit liability from the Respondents. Further, according to him, an order sanctioning scheme of arrangement operates as judgment in rem, which is good against the whole world and not only bind the parties to the arrangement, but also to the third parties and strangers. By drawing the principle laid down in In re Europlast India Ltd.17, which has pronounced that the scheme of arrangement ""represents a contract sanctified by a Courts' approval between the company and the creditors and/or members of the company....sanction of the Court operates as judgment in rem"", Mr.Seervai described the argument advanced on behalf of the Petitioner to be monstrously egregious, which therefore must meet rejection. It is his 16 (2011) 12 SCC 588 17 2010 Supp BomCR 425 33/168 CARBP-414-18.odt specific contention that if the Petitioner is submitting that it is not seeking recognition in Respondent Nos.2 and 3, since no role is attributed to them, but despite this, they are foisted with the consequences.",,"""... RBI approval has been obtained for IMAX Theaters in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi....",
,,"5. With the introduction of the Parties, I shall now refer to the subject Agreement, entered in form of ""Master Agreement""","With these background facts, IMAX has filed Arbitration Petition under Section 47, 48, 49 of the Act of 1996, seeking enforcement of the three Awards in its favour under the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1996 and also praying for its execution in form of decrees.","14. Mr. Chinoy would rely upon the pleadings in the Petition, in an attempt to demonstrate that the Respondents had in a clandestine manner with a clear intention of defrauding Petitioners claim on the arbitral awards, divested assets E-City Entertainment in favour of E-City Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. and E- City Project Construction Pvt. Ltd., by approaching the court under Section 391 to 394 of the Companies Act 1956, to demerge the valuable assets in favour of the two entities.
In the Petition, the sequence of events reflecting the scheme of arrangement between the E-City Entertainment and the Respondents nos.2 and 3 is specifically pleaded as a deliberate attempt of the Respondents to transfer a substantial portion of E-City Entertainment's assets by preventing IMAX from receiving notice of this transfer, so that it could not object to the fraudulent demerger.
Mr. Chinoy has specifically stressed on the timelines, by submitting that the Petitioner is now facing a scenario, as E- City Entertainment and Essel Group, have improperly tried to avoid compensating the Petitioner IMAX from the Arbitral Awards and the assets of E-City Entertainment were 16/168 CARBP-414-18.odt fraudulently stripped, when it became clear in the arbitration proceedings, that IMAX would receive damages. It is also alleged that the E-City Entertainment being a group company belonging to Essel Group is under common control and management of its promoters who control all the companies and have been successful in fraudulently siphoning the assets and funds from E-City Entertainment to defeat satisfaction of the Arbitral Awards.
According to Mr.Chinoy the group of companies should be treated as one concern, especially when a parent Company owns all the shares of the subsidiaries and exercise control over it and in the present case, the Respondent/E-City Real Estate and E-City Project Construction are the companies owned by the Essel Group Promoters and each of them should be treated as an alter ego of E-City Entertainment and shall receive a treatment as ""single entity'.
The Demerger process from E-City Entertainment to E- City Real Estate and E-City Projects Construction, without giving notice to IMAX as the largest contingent creditor was a sham, according to Mr.Chinoy, as it was done with a fraudulent intention to place the assets of E- City Entertainment beyond the reach of IMAX.
According to the learned senior counsel, the sole reason for carrying out the purported corporate restructuring was to enable the management and/or beneficial owners of the E-City Entertainment to recommence their business after the insolvency of the E-City Entertainment and, according to him, IMAX was the largest creditor of E-City Entertainment and it has been put in a position, of it being unable to satisfy the 17/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Arbitral Awards. The demerged companies, E-City Real Estate and E-City Projects Construction including E-City Investments which is the ultimate holding company of the demerged companies are presently owning the assets of E-City Entertainment and are running the business undertakings which were previously part of E-City Entertainment, having left the creditor, the E-City Entertainment without any recourse, is his contention.",,"According to him, the issue of limitation will have to be decided in accordance with the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Vedanta Limited(supra) and the only inevitable conclusion is, that the Petition is hopelessly barred by Law of Limitation.","E-City while admitting that an agreement was entered into on 22/11/2000 in respect of one IMAX system, specifically adopted a stand that the execution of purchase and maintenance agreement was not done in response to an obligation purportedly contained in the LOI, as alleged in the statement of case and saved by the claimant's letter dated 20/12/2000 and countersigned by the respondent, the purchase and maintenance agreements were terminated.","It is specifically urged by Mr.Seervai that in the present proceedings, IMAX has failed to assert as to when the cause of action arose for it against the Respondents and when it derived knowledge of the said cause of action, since the pleadings in the Petition are completely silent on this aspect and, therefore, it is not open for the Court to decide such an important issue in absence of pleadings, as it would defeat the purpose of the Limitation Act, 1963. It is his specific contention that the fact of demerger was known to IMAX as far 35/168 CARBP-414-18.odt back as June 2011 and, therefore, this ought to have been reckoned as starting point for limitation insofar as the group companies are concerned, but institution of the present proceedings in April 2018, which is beyond the period of three years of limitation, the proceedings must fail.",,"In each of these transactions, the transaction has been structured or restructured as a sale from the standard Imax lease transaction.",

Mr. Chinoy has specifically invited my attention to the pleadings in the Petition to the following effect :-
""63. The majority of the assets of the E-City Entertainment were transferred to the E-City Real Estate under Scheme 1 and to the E-City Projects Construction under Scheme 2. As a consequence of same, very less of the assets remained vested in E-City Entertainment. As against the highly depleted assets, E-City Entertainment had on its books of accounts a huge contingent liability which E-City Entertainment knew would become an actual Award. Indeed, the actual damages Award was rendered by the Arbitration Panel while the Scheme 2 demerger was pending, but the Demerger Petition was never amended to inform this Hon'ble Court. As shown by the facts discussed above, all of the Respondents and Directors of all the Respondents conspired against the Petitioner by draining E-City Entertainment's assets. Given the award of damages which the Arbitral Tribunal has awarded, as a result of the sham demerger Petitioner it will not be able to recover the full amount awarded from E-City Entertainment. Further, all the Respondents have conspired together to fraudulently transfer the assets of E-City Entertainment in favor of E-City Real Estate and E-City Projects Construction. E-City Real Estate and E-City Projects Construction are an alter-ego of E-City Entertainment and therefore should be treated as a ""single entity""",,"Mr. Seksaria has invited my attention to the following decisions in support of his contention, that such a transaction is against the fundamental policy of India :-

In this factual background, it is the submission of Mr.Seksaria that the issue of limitation is a pure question of 22/168 CARBP-414-18.odt law and hence it do not operate as res judicata or an issue estoppel since it is founded on principle of public policy. He would place reliance upon the decision of Apex Court in the case of Pundlik Jalam Patil (Dead) by LRs Vs. Executive Engineer, Jalgaon, Medium Project & Anr .3 as well as decision in the case of Manindra Land & Building Corporation Ltd. Vs. Bhutnath Banerjee & Ors.4. It is his specific contention that the issue of limitation goes to the root of the matter and if an Application is barred by Law of Limitation, the Court do not have any authority or jurisdiction to entertain such an Application and since the issue of limitation is an issue affecting jurisdiction, an erroneous decision of the court would not operate as res judicata, at a subsequent stage between the parties, because it is considered to be conclusive, as it will assume status of a special rule of law.

In support of his contention that no erroneous decision on a pure question of law which has been expressly overruled, and set at naught by the Supreme Court can be argued, as being binding inter party , he would place reliance upon the decision in case of Mathura Prasasd Bajoo Jaiswal & Ors. Vs. Dossibai N.B. Jeejeebhoy5, and in the case of Canara Bank Vs. N.G.Subbaraya Setty & Anr.6.

It is also the contention of Mr. Seksaria that the Court in any case has an inherent power, coupled with the duty to recall an erroneous order and or to rectify such an error and though in the realm of law, the Courts and Statutes lean in favour of finality of the decision, exceptions; both statutory and 3 (2008) 17 SCC 448 4 AIR 1964 SC 1336 5 (1970) 1 SCC 613 6 (2018) 16 SCC 228 23/168 CARBP-414-18.odt judicially, have been carved out to correct mistakes when there is no statutory provision, or rules framed in that regard.",,"According to Mr.Jagtiani, when the arbitration proceedings commenced between the Petitioner and Respondent No.1 alone, on 16/06/2004, the Petitioner never sought impleadment of Respondent No.4. In the scheme of arrangement approved by the Bombay High Court, being ""Scheme 1"" when Respondent No.2 was de-merged from Respondent No.1 and ""Scheme 2"", when Respondent No.3 was de-merged from Respondent No.1, Respondent No.4 was a shareholder in Respondent No.1 and it became a shareholder in the resultant entities i.e. Respondent Nos.2 and 3.","In addition, IMAX sought a turnover order directing the respondents to deliver sufficient funds to justify the judgment or to deliver their personal property to the Sheriff of the country of New York to satisfy the judgment pursuant to the CPLR 5225(b). The Supreme Court of State of New York, County of New York by its decision dated 9/10/2015, however, denied the prayer of IMAX, to the effect that the judgment be recognized against the respondents by treating them as alter- ego or as a single personality as E-City. Recording that IMAX have failed to show that the respondents have one and the same entity as E-City, its request for an order to domesticate the Canadian judgment was denied.","The Master Agreement, a detail 11 page agreement set forth a comprehensive plan under which E-City was awarded exclusivity to become IMAX's primary business partner of the large and lucrative Indian Market. In return, E-City committed to lease at least six theatre systems from IMAX at agreed upon prices and dates with a possibility of leasing 14 additional IMAX systems. E-City for a period of time abided by its commitment, but faced the accusation that it took advantage of its exclusivity rights. However, in 2003, when it informed IMAX that it no longer wanted to pursue the Master Agreement, for internal financial reasons and it was scaling back on the development of the family fund centres throughout 44/168 CARBP-414-18.odt India in which it had intended to place IMAX systems, IMAX was aggrieved and alleged default of all of their initial payment obligations under the terms of the Master Agreement, which contemplated E-City to have finished making payments for initial rent for all six systems to IMAX by 15, December 2004, but failed to do so.",,"Since the partial final award on jurisdiction and quantum is passed without taking into consideration the material issue raised that without RBI's approval, the agreement was unenforceable, in the place of its performance i.e. India, and since the award failed to take into consideration the imperative mandate of seeking RBI's approval under the law of the country, on the objection of the E-City that the enforcement of the awards would be contrary to the public policy in India, I deem it appropriate to accept the said contention and in the wake of the finding rendered above, decline the enforcement of the arbitral awards in favour of IMAX.",
,,"7. The aforesaid Arbitration proceedings resulted into three Awards :

(a) On 09/02/2006, the Arbitral Tribunal issued a partial Award (final as to liability-the ""Liability Award"") stating that the Master Agreement in fact gave rise to legally binding obligations and that E-City Entertainment had breached its obligation to lease all of the six (6) systems required under the Master Agreement. The Liability Award ordered an assessment of damages suffered by IMAX.
(b) On 24/08/2007, the Arbitral Tribunal issued an Award on the damages phase of the arbitration (the ""Quantum 9/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Award"") holding that E-City Entertainment was required to pay IMAX a sum of U.S. $ 9,406,148.31 (approximately INR 62,22,21,478.86) plus interest at 2% in excess of the prime rate in Canada on that amount, as provided for in the Respondent's contract.
(c) After further briefing on the issue of costs and interest, a Final Arbitral Award was declared on 27/03/2008 (the ""Final Award"") holding that Respondent, E-City Entertainment is liable to pay to the Petitioner IMAX (i) U.S. $ 1,118,558.54 (approximately INR 7,39,86,305.03) by way of interest up to and including 30/09/2007, (ii) U.S. $ 2,512.60 (approximately INR 1,66,215.69) per day from 01/10/2007 until payment of the Award amounting to U.S. $ 9,406,148.31 (approximately INR 62,22,21,478.86) (iii) costs by way of attorney's fees, export fees and related expenses in the sum of U.S. $ 84,789.21 (approximately INR 56,08,854.62) (iv) U.S. $ 400,000 (approximately INR 2,64,53,245.69) fixed by the ICC as the costs of the arbitration to the Respondent.

According to E-City, the Petitioner is seeking attachment of properties by the present Application to which an objection under Order 21 Rule 58 can be raised and it would be tried as if it was an independent Suit and in any case, no prejudice is caused to the Petitioner if it is relegated to the execution being availed in the previously filed proceedings, if the Court recognize the Award and permit enforcement.

While advancing his submission about the Master Agreement being violative of RBI Notification, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 as well as the Foreign Exchange Management Rules, 2000, Mr.Seksaria has elaborated that the Agreement contemplated entering into an execution of Lease Agreements post negotiations in good faith on or before 30/11/2000, as it was in the background of Final Letter Agreement/Master Agreement being entered between IMAX and E-City to open and develop Twenty (20) theatres in India with E-city's initial commitment to lease six (6) IMAX systems from IMAX.
",,"32. The learned senior counsel representing Respondent No.4 has also relied upon the most fundamental principle of company law, being that the company is an independent legal entity distinct from its shareholders and any claim against the company must be made against the company itself and not the shareholders, whose liability is restricted to the value of shares in the company and, therefore, the shareholder cannot be made made liable for company's debts, subject to certain limited exceptions.","This submission is strongly contested by Mr.Seksaria who has opposed the petition on the ground that is not entitled to seek the relief of execution by filing a combined petition, as it has already filed a separate Execution Application under Order 21 Rule 11 of CPC (CEXA 49/2017) even prior to the filing of the present petition which is pending and this Court has kept it in abeyance, by recording that both the Execution Application as well as the Chamber Summons, will have to abate the outcome of the Arbitration Petition.","A claim was made in damages in US Dollars expressed to be ""simply the amount that would have been paid to IMAX by E-City, had E-City fully performed its obligations under the contract"", and the breakdown of the net owed was set out in paragraph No.36 of the Statement of Claim.",,"(iv) Maintaining the fairness of the trial inchides fairness to the witness whose evidence is being impugned, whether on the basis of dishonesty, inaccuracy or other inadequacy.

By inviting my attention to the position of law emerging from the various authoritative pronouncements, Mr.Jagtiani has submitted that Respondent No.1 was incorporated in the year 1999 and the Master Agreement was entered with the Petitioner on 28/09/2000, with a limited object to be achieved and it was essentially a holding company, holding the shares of various entities. On the date on which the Master Agreement was entered into, Respondent No.4 was not even in existence and, therefore, it is not a signatory thereto. Until the Enforcement Petition was filed, it was not made a party to any of the proceedings instituted by the Petitioner, including its application for recognition of Awards, which was filed before the Supreme Court of Justice Ontario, Canada as well as the application for enforcement filed before the Supreme Court of the State of New York and also the Execution Application No.49 of 2017, but it is for the first time, Respondent No.4 is impleaded in the proceedings on the pretext that Respondent No.4 hold shares in Respondent Nos.1 to 3 and the overlapping identity of the Directors of Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.4 by holding it responsible for the alleged fraudulent act of moving assets from the Respondent No.1 to Respondent Nos.2 and 3, by way of scheme of demerger and by piercing the corporate veil of Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.4, an attempt is made to make it liable for debts of Respondent No.1.","61.

It is also his submission that though the pleadings in the Petition are based on Group Company Doctrine, but during the course of argument, the said stand is given up, in the wake of the prevailing situation.","According to Mr.Seksaria, the learned single Judge of this Court, while deciding the preliminary issue of limitation on 13/11/2019 had declared that the period of limitation available was 12 years, but it is his submission that the order passed by the learned Single Judge is wiped from its existence and in any case does not operate as res judicata or issue estoppel. Since mere filing of Petition under Section 34 did not operate as automatic say of an Arbitration Award, Mr. Seksaria would submit that E-City Entertainment filed Special Leave Petition against order dated 13.11.2019 before the Supreme Court, which granted interim order staying the Judgment dated 13/11/2019, on 10/01/2020.","In the wake of the scheme of Part II of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and, in particular, Sections 44 and 45 and Sections 47 and 48, it is his specific submission that the proceedings for recognition and enforcement of Award cannot lie against Respondent Nos.2 and 3. Emphasising upon the cardinal principle underlying the aforesaid provisions, it is his contention that the award is against Respondent No.1 and a bare look at Section 48, which has set out the conditions for enforcement of foreign awards, the emphasis is on the words, ""party against whom it is invoked"" and the enforcement of a foreign award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the Court a proof of circumstances set out in the provision and in the wake of the argument advanced by the learned senior counsel Mr.Chinoy, Mr.Seervai has described the impleadment of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 as nothing but misuse of the proceedings, as Respondent Nos.2 and 3 are no less than a stranger, as they were not party to arbitration proceedings nor there exists an Award against them.",,"By inviting my attention to the pleadings in the Petition pertaining to the purported fraud attributed to Respondent No.4, Mr.Jagtiani has submitted that the case of the Petitioner merely rest on bare statement that there was fraud and there is reference to the commonality of the shareholding and 43/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Directorship and, therefore, Respondent No.4 should be made liable. But, since the Petitioner has failed to discharge the burden of establishing fraud, against the shareholders of Respondent No.4's promoters, which is more essential in post- award proceedings, the Court shall not oblige it by piercing the veil only on the basis of stray, bare and unsubstantiated averments. It is therefore pleaded by Mr.Jagtiani that the Chamber Summons filed by Respondent No.4 should be allowed and its name be struck off from the Petition.","It is well settled principle that the law aids those who are vigilant in invoking the remedies available to them within the prescribe time-lines and not to those, who sleep over their rights.","E-City, in its Statement of Defence, also placed on record the correspondence exchanged with the Control Department of the Reserve Bank of India of Bombay, seeking approval to make the necessary remittances, which resulted in the Bank writing to the General Manager of Exchange Control Department of the RBI, requesting permission to accede to E- City's request for remittance of US$ 3,00,000 towards first tranche in token of the acceptance in view of the arrangement proposed to be entered with the overseas party.",,131/168 CARBP-414-18.odt,

By concluding that in the interest of justice, the case required the name of the claimant to be changed from 'IMAX Limited' to 'IMAX Corporation', to reflect that position under the Canadian Law, the Tribunal declined to accept the narrow view of Section 186, which was advanced on behalf of the respondent and preferred the evidence of Mr.Farley Q.C as to the status of IMAX Limited upon merger to the effect that it be regarded as the same Company as IMAX Corporation.

In addition to the aforesaid argument, Mr.Seervai has also raised a point that the Petition is barred by limitation and has referred to the earlier order passed by this Court, when the issue of limitation was agitated by E-City Entertainment and the proceedings were disposed off by order dated 13/11/2019 by the learned Single Judge, by recording a finding that the enforcement/execution proceedings were within limitation on account of the application of Article 136 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 and this order was assailed before the Apex Court, when the challenge was not entertained and the review thereof was also dismissed on 16/08/2023.",,,"However, this statement is not as regards E-City as per the agreement, but was a general statement, as the subject agreement was for lease and not for sale.","It is with this intention that the legislature has conferred the right to object to the enforcement of an award at the instance of the party against whom it is invoked and, since, the grounds on which the objection can be raised, are clearly stipulated by the legislature, and speak of incapacity of parties and the agreement to be invalid under the law to which the parties have subjected it, an attempt to bring non-parties within this ground has been described to be trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.",,"131.

Necessity of piercing the corporate veil and making those behind the veil i.e. shareholders liable for the debts of the company, according to Mr.Jagtiani, must meet a very high threshold and the standard to be met for permitting piercing the corporate veil as laid down in Balwant Rai Saluja & Anr. Vs. Air India Limited & Ors.22 is once again relied upon by Mr.Jagtiani. In addition, he has also placed reliance upon the decisions of the Apex Court in Indowind Energy Ltd. Vs. Wescare (India) Limited & Anr.23 and Vodafone International Holdings BV Vs. Union of India & Ors. 24, where the parameters of piercing the corporate veil are set out.

Even Mr.Jagtiani has reiterated the argument that fraud is not the magic mantra to vitiate any transaction, as fraud must be pleaded in detail, with material particulars being divulged as Order VI Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1098 requires a party to give material particulars in cases, where misrepresentation, fraud is alleged and in fact, several courts from time to time have held that the threshold for meeting a case of fraud is extremely high, as in any proceedings, not only the plea of fraud is required to be specifically pleaded, but also proved.

Severn Trent Water Purification Inc. & Ors.27, when the Hon'ble Supreme Court pronounced upon an issue as to whether a party could invoke arbitration in respect of an arbitration agreement to which it was not a signatory; and if it can do so, the parameters within which such invocation would be invalid, Mr.Jagtiani has clarified that Chloro Controls India Pvt. Ltd. was rendered in the context of an expressed statutory provision in Part II to extend the arbitration agreements to non-signatories, namely, Section 45 of the Act. According to him, the Apex Court permitted impleadment of the party at the pre-arbitration stage. However, it was reiterated that ordinarily an arbitration agreement takes place between the persons, who are the parties to the arbitration agreement and the substantive contract underlining the agreement. However, only in certain circumstances, a non-signatory should be subjected to arbitration, without prior consent, but it would be an exceptional case. However, by the subsequent decision in the case of Cox and Kings Ltd. (supra), it was clarified that principle of piercing the corporate veil cannot be the sole basis for impleading a non-signatory under the Group of Companies Doctrine and it would require more, such as the common intention of the parties to participate in the transaction.

In any case, if the high burden to subject a non-signatory to arbitration has been met, the consequence would be that the non-signatory participates in the arbitration and has the opportunity to present its case.

""Exceptionally, the English court will not enforce or recognise a right conferred or a duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the facts of the particular case, enforcement or, as the case may be, 91/168 CARBP-414-18.odt recognition, would be contrary to a fundamental policy of English law.

It also covers drafts, travellers cheques, letters of credit or bills of exchange drawn by banks, institutions or persons outside India, but payable in Indian currency.",,"Deliberating on the two contra opinions, the Tribunal accepted Mr.Farley's view that having regard to the 164/168 CARBP-414-18.odt substantive law on continuance and amalgamation, the Ontario Courts would regard the amendment of the title of the action as a matter of form, not substance; and that an amendment would be permitted. Further observing that under Ontario law, the Court would allow amendments to pleadings at any stage of an action, unless prejudice would result that could not be dealt with by costs or adjournment, the Tribunal expressed its view that by change of the word ""Limited"" to the word ""Corporation"" in the title of the arbitration, no prejudice is caused to the Respondent. It, therefore, recorded its conclusion in the following words :-

""36. The Tribunal has no doubt, therefore, given the view of the substantive law set out by Mr.Farley QC in his opinion, that the interests of justice in this case require the name of the Claimant be changed from IMAX Limited to IMAX Corporation to reflect the position under Canadian law. As Mr.Farley QC has explained in his conclusion :
""As a matter of Canadian corporate law, the rights and obligations of Imax ltd. continued with effect from January 1, 2001 (the date of amalgamation) in Imax Corporation. These include the right to initiate proceedings under the September 28, 2000 document. The fact that the proceedings were instituted in the name of one of the amalgamating corporations does not in any way affect the validity of those proceedings, the claim, or any findings made to date. The error in the style of cause does not render the proceedings a nullity, and is a mere irregularity that, if brought before the Ontario Courts, would be corrected by way of an amendment to the pleadings. In my opinion, based on my experience, and for all the reasons noted above, it is inconceivable to me that such a change would not be permitted.""",

The Scheme of Section 47 to 49 of Part II of the Act of 1996, envisage two step process i.e. recognition and enforcement and execution, and Section 49 creating a legal 53/168 CARBP-414-18.odt fiction, by providing that the award shall be a decree, when it is held to be enforceable.

In TOEPFER (supra), the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in paragraph nos.18 and 19, has thrown light upon the deeming fiction, when he recorded thus :-

""18. Hence, I find that all objections raised to the validity of the Award have no force. I am satisfied that the award is perfectly in accordance with the provisions of GAFTA Rules and is fit one to be enforced as a Foreign Award under Chapter II of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
19. By prayer (a) in the petition, it is prayed that this Court be pleased to enforce the award dated 30th September, 1997 Exh. O to the petition. In my view, such a prayer cannot be granted under the provisions of the Act 1996. In my opinion, Section 49 of the Act merely empowers the Court to declare that the Foreign Award is enforceable under the provisions of Chapter II of the Act. The moment such a declaration is granted, an award shall be deemed to be a decree of the Court. Once its deemed to be a decree of the Court, it is open to the parties to seek its execution in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.""",,,"153. With a specific stand being adopted on behalf of the claimant that Imax Ltd. was the same as Imax Corporation, although as a precaution, it was sought the joinder of the Imax Corporation, which in fact was unnecessary given that both the entities were same and all that was necessary was for the purpose of arbitration to change the word ""Limited"" to the word ""Corporation"". Mr.Farley QC had opined in support of Mr.Cooperman's submission, opining that Imax Corporation is possessed of all its predecessor amalgamating corporations' 163/168 CARBP-414-18.odt rights and privileges, including those under pre-existing contracts and agreements with third parties. If the name of the amalgamating corporation is used, the amalgamated corporation has the rights and obligations entered into under its amalgamating corporation's name. Certainly, to avoid confusion, the name of the amalgamated corporation should be used in business operations.","93/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Chapter II of FEMA, prescribing regulations and management of foreign exchange, impose prohibition on a person to deal in or transfer any foreign exchange or foreign security to any person, making payment to or for the credit of any person resident outside India in any manner; receiving otherwise through an authorised person, any payment by order or on behalf of any person resident outside India in any manner. Similarly, by virtue of Section 4, a person resident in India, is prohibited from acquiring, holding, owning, possessing or transferring any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India. Similarly, the Capital Account Transactions, as contemplated in Sections 5 and 6, necessarily contemplate the approval from the RBI/Central Government.",,"156. In addition, I have concluded that the Petition is barred by limitation, since in light of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Vedanta Ltd.(supra), the enforcement and execution of a foreign award shall be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and though it is permissible to condone the delay, but in absence of the Petitioner seeking condonation of delay, and rather assertively staking the claim that the Petition is within limitation, I am left with no option,but to dismiss the Petition.",

(E) Whether it is permissible for the Petitioner to raise a challenge to the demerger scheme as a collateral challenge, particularly when the scheme of demerger was approved by a competent Company Court?","48. In Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd. 28, the Apex Court has held that a proceeding seeking recognition and enforcement of a foreign award has different stages; in the first stage, the Court would decide about the enforceability of the award on having regard to the requirements of Section 47 and 48 of the Act of 1996. Once the enforceability is decided, then necessary steps would be required to be taken for execution of the award and it is relevant to reproduce the observation of the Apex Court to the following effect :-

""31. Prior to the enforcement of the Act, the Law of Arbitration in this country was substantially contained in three enactments namely (1) The Arbitration Act, 1940, (2) The Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 and (3) The Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. A party holding a foreign award was required to take recourse to these enactments. Preamble of the Act makes it abundantly clear that it 28 (2001) 6 SCC 356 54/168 CARBP-414-18.odt aims at to consolidate and amend Indian laws relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The object of the Act is to minimize supervisory role of court and to give speedy justice. In this view, the stage of approaching court for making award a rule of court as required in Arbitration Act, 1940 is dispensed with in the present Act. If the argument of the respondent is accepted, one of the objects of the Act will be frustrated and defeated. Under the old Act, after making award and prior to execution, there was a procedure for filing and making an award a rule of court i.e. a decree. Since the object of the act is to provide speedy and alternative solution of the dispute, the same procedure cannot be insisted under the new Act when it is advisedly eliminated. If separate proceedings are to be taken, one for deciding the enforceability of a foreign award and the other thereafter for execution, it would only contribute to protracting the litigation and adding to the sufferings of a litigant in terms of money, time and energy. Avoiding such difficulties is one of the objects of the Act as can be gathered from the scheme of the Act and particularly looking to the provisions contained in Sections 46 to 49 in relation to enforcement of foreign award. In para 40 of the Thyssen judgment already extracted above, it is stated that as a matter of fact, there is not much difference between the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Act in the matter of enforcement of foreign award. The only difference as found is that while under the Foreign Award Act a decree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in our view, a party holding foreign award can apply for enforcement of it but the court before taking further effective steps for the execution of the award has to proceed in accordance with Sections 47 to 49. In one proceeding there may be different stages. In the first stage the Court may have to decide about the enforceability of the award having regard to the requirement of the said provisions. Once the court decides that foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take further effective steps for execution of the same. There arises no question of making foreign award as a rule of court/decree again. If the object and purpose can be served in the same proceedings, in our view, there is no need to take two separate proceedings resulting in multiplicity of litigation. It is also clear from objectives contained in para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons, Sections 47 to 49 and Scheme of the Act that every final arbitral award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of the court. The submission that the execution petition could not be permitted to convert as an application under Section 47 is technical and is of no consequence in the view we have taken. In our opinion, for enforcement of foreign award there is no need to take separate proceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of the award to make rule of the court or decree and the other to take up execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as already stated above, the court enforcing a foreign award can deal with the entire matter. Even otherwise, this procedure does not prejudice a party in the light of what is stated in para 40 of the Thyssen judgment.
55/168 CARBP-414-18.odt",,,"157. Though it is sought to be argued on behalf of Respondent No.1 that there was no valid invocation for the reference to the Arbitral Tribunal and an objection is also raised to the composition of the Tribunal, coupled with non-compliance of ICC rules and the ground that proper authority to file claim was not determined is also pressed into service on behalf of E- City, as some of the points on which, the enforcement of the awards is opposed by it, in the wake of the finding rendered above, I have already formed an opinion that the awards do not deserve enforcement and execution in light of the scheme contained in Part II, Chapter I of the Act of 1996 under the New York Convention awards, I have refrained myself from considering the said issues.","Since the agreement between the parties was contingent upon approval of the RBI, it assumed the character of statutory contract and violation of the stipulation of obtaining the approval/permission, has potential to make the contract void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. If it is so, it then becomes against the fundamental policy of India and what is urged by Mr.Seksaria, is that enforcement of an award, which fails to recognise the fundamental policy of India must be refused, as any remittance made in contravention of the public policy of India relating to the Export Control Regulation and remittance of foreign exchange, without the approval of RBI/Government of India would impact the enforcement of the Award.",,"Similarly, I have also expressed that the impleadment of Respondent Nos.2 to 4 in the Petition is unwarranted and specifically when Mr.Chinoy has set out his intention clear and loud, that the Respondent Nos.2 to 4 are impleaded, based on an assumption that the assets of E-City are diverted through them.",

  (G)      Whether the invocation of arbitration by IMAX Limited,
which has merged into IMAX Corporation, was invalid? I shall deal with the above issues sequentially.","49. The applicability of Sections 47 to 49 in regard to the foreign award was once again tested in Vedanta Limited (supra) when the scheme of 1996 Act for enforcement of New York Convention Awards was focused upon and it is held that under the Act of 1996, there is no requirement for the foreign award to be filed before the Seat Court and obtain a decree thereon, after which it becomes enforceable as a foreign decree. Recording that the requirement under the Geneva Convention 1927, being referred to as ""Double exequatur"" was done away with the New York Convention and under the Act of 1996, a party may apply for recognition and enforcement of a foreign award, without obtaining leave from the Court of the seat in which, or under the laws of which the award was made.
Discussing the scheme of the Act of 1996 and from Section 44 to 47, the Apex Court observed thus :-

""83.2 Section 44 of the 1996 Act provides that a New York Convention award would be enforceable, if the award is with respect to a commercial dispute, covered by a written agreement in a State with which the Government of India has a reciprocal relationship, as notified in the Official Gazette.
83.3 Section 46 provides that a foreign award which is enforceable under Chapter 1 of Part II of the 1996 Act, shall be treated as final and binding on the parties, and can be relied upon by way of defence, set off, or otherwise, in any legal proceeding in India.
83.4 Section 47 sets out the procedure for filing the petition for enforcement / execution of a foreign award. This section replicates Article IV (1) of the New York Convention which requires the applicant to file the authenticated copy of the original award, or a certified copy thereof, along with the original agreement referred to in Article II, or a certified copy thereof, at the time of filing the petition.
83.10 Section 48 replicates Article V of the New York Convention, and sets out the limited conditions on which the enforcement of a foreign award may be refused. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Sections 48 contain seven grounds for refusal to enforce a foreign award. Sub-section (1) contains five grounds which may be raised by the losing party for refusal of enforcement of the 56/168 CARBP-414-18.odt foreign award, while sub-section (2) contains two grounds which the court may ex officio invoke to refuse enforcement of the award,31 i.e. non-arbitrability of the subject-matter of the dispute under the laws of India; and second, the award is in conflict with the public policy of India.
83.11 The enforcement Court cannot set aside a foreign award, even if the conditions under Section 48 are made out. The power to set aside a foreign award vests only with the court at the seat of arbitration, since the supervisory or primary jurisdiction is exercised by the curial courts at the seat of arbitration. The enforcement court may ""refuse"" enforcement of a foreign award, if the conditions contained in Section 48 are made out. This would be evident from the language of the Section itself, which provides that enforcement of a foreign award may be ""refused"" only if the applicant furnishes proof of any of the conditions contained in Section 48 of the Act.
83.13 The grounds for refusing enforcement of foreign awards contained in Section 48 are exhaustive, which is evident from the language of the Section, which provides that enforcement may be refused ""only if"" the applicant furnishes proof of any of the conditions contained in that provision.
83.14 The enforcement court is not to correct the errors in the award under Section 48, or undertake a review on the merits of the award, but is conferred with the limited power to ""refuse""
enforcement, if the grounds are made out.

83.15 If the Court is satisfied that the application under Section 48 is without merit, and the foreign award is found to be enforceable, then under Section 49, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of ""that Court"". The limited purpose of the legal fiction is for the purpose of the enforcement of the foreign award. The concerned High Court would then enforce the award by taking recourse to the provisions of Order XXII of the CPC.""",,,,"90. The Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing or lending in foreign exchange) Regulations, 2000 was enacted in exercise of power conferred by RBI under Section 47 of FEMA, for borrowing or lending foreign exchange from or to a person resident in or outside India, though RBI may for sufficient reason, permit a person to do so. The same regulation also prescribed as below :-

""3. An importer in India may, for import of goods into India, avail of foreign currency credit for a period not exceeding six months extended by the overseas supplier of goods, provided the import is in compliance with the Export Import Policy of the Government of India in force.""",,"167/168 CARBP-414-18.odt There could be definitely no challenge raised to the demerger schemes, which by this time are settled, with the sanction from the Company Court in the country and they cannot be re-opened.",
,,,"In the wake of the above, Issue No.A is answered by holding that a common petition seeking enforcement and execution as a deemed decree is maintainable in the wake of the law laid down in case of Vedanta Limited (supra) and the issue is answered in favour of the Petitioner, by holding that a common petition can be entertained for enforcement and execution of the three awards.","50. Though Mr.Seksaria would lay his emphasis on the observation in paragraph no.83.11, in my view, the said observation cannot be read in isolation, but reading of the whole of para 83 with its different parts, it is evidently clear that the enforcement Court may refuse enforcement of a foreign award, if a person against whom it is invoked, is able to offer proof and make out a case under clauses (a) to (e) of the said provision, amounting to the conditions perforcing the Court to refuse the enforcement of the award. A Court may 57/168 CARBP-414-18.odt also refuse enforcement by retaining a residual discretion to overrule the objections, only if it finds that overall justice has been done between the parties and may direct enforcement of the award, but by going through the scheme contemplated in Chapter I of Part II, it is sufficiently clear that in the first stage, the Court would decide about the sustainability and enforceability of the Award and only when the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter, a deeming fiction kicks in, and the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that Court. The second stage evidently is executing the said decree and this would be definitely done as per the manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure.
",,,,"93. FEMA 1999 replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, (for short 'FERA') is enacted with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. The earlier enactment FERA, which had become incompatible with pro-liberalization policies of the Government of India was substituted by a new regime, in form of a regulatory mechanism that enable the Reserve Bank of India to pass regulations and the Central Government to make Rules, relating to foreign exchange in tune with the foreign trade policy of India. Unlike other Laws where everything is permitted unless specifically prohibited, under FERA of 1973, everything was prohibited unless specifically permitted and noticing that the tone and tenor of the existing legislation was very drastic, it was substituted by the FEMA, which liberalized foreign exchange control and restrictions on foreign investment as the management of foreign exchange becomes necessary and made the transactions for external trade more easier and simpler. The switch to FEMA is clearly marked by the change in the approach on the part of the Government by 'managing' the foreign exchange instead of regulating it and FEMA proceeds on principal that all current 99/168 CARBP-414-18.odt account transactions are permitted unless expressly prohibited and all capital account transactions are prohibited unless expressly permitted.",,"From the awards passed against Respondent No.1 and in favour of IMAX, a foreign party, who has not even supplied the goods under the agreement, but which is held entitled for a huge sum of money under the awards and the money will be taken out of this country, without the stipulation of the agreement being complied with and since, this shock the conscious of the Court, the enforcement and execution of awards, as prayed by the Petitioner in the Petition, is declined.",
,,,"60. Respondent No.1 has resisted the recognition of the awards on the ground that the Petition, has been filed after five years and, hence, is barred by the law of limitation.","51. In the wake of the decision in the case of Vedanta Limited (supra), where it is clearly pronounced that there is no need to take two separate proceedings i.e. one for deciding the enforceability (recognition) of the award as a deemed decree and then separate proceeding for execution of the deemed decree thereafter, and it is open for the award holder to apply for recognition and execution of a foreign award by common petition.

In stage 1, the Court would decide the enforceability of the award as a deemed decree, on satisfying the requirement of Section 47 and 48. Once the Court decides that a foreign award is enforceable as a decree of that Court, it shall proceed to take effective steps for its execution as a deemed decree and then would take recourse to the provision of Order 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure.",,,,"The object of FEMA is to protect Indian economy from loss of foreign exchange and to not permit the foreign exchange to be repatriated outside India unless certain prior mandatory stipulations are satisfied. Since FEMA intended to maintain financial stability by monitoring and regulating foreign investment and transactions by preventing abrupt capital movements that would destabilise the economy with a dual object of facilitating external trade and payments and also attracting and management foreign investment alongwith safeguarding the interest of resident Indians, it also created offences for non compliance of its provisions.",,"The Petition, therefore, stands dismissed with no order as to costs.",

If the contract, express or implied, is forbidden by law, definitely no Court shall render assistance to such a Contract. The expression ""public policy"" concerning the agreement relates to the public policy of the country where award is being enforced. Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872 deals with what consideration and objects are lawful and what not. If the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy, in that event, the consideration or object of agreement is said to be unlawful, and any agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful, is void.",,,
,,,"71. It is trite position of law that issue of limitation is a pure question of law and would partake as an issue of jurisdiction and, therefore, may not operate as res judicata or an issue of estoppel.","54. Section 44 of the Act of 1996 has set out the necessary ingredients for an award to be ""a foreign award"" and it contemplate the following :-

(a) It must be an arbitral award on differences between the persons arising out of legal relationship;
(b) The difference may in contract or outside the contract;
(c) The legal relationship so spoken of ought to be considered ""commercial"" under the law in India;
(d) The award must be made on or after 11/10/1960;
(e) The award must be a New York Convention award i.e. it must be in pursuance of an agreement in writing to 60/168 CARBP-414-18.odt which the New York Convention applies and be in one of such territories;
(f) It must be made in one of such territories which the Central Government by notification declares to be territories to which the New York Convention applies.
Though the term ""legal relationship"" is not defined in the Act, it is intended to be convey a relationship, which gave rise to legal obligations and duties. The expression ""commercial"" is construed to be broadly having regard to the manifold activities which are integral part of international trade.",,,,"102. To overcome this effect , the Law Commission of India, in the year 2014 recommended insertion of Section 34 (2A) to deal with purely domestic Awards which were permitted to be set aside if the Court find that such Award is vitiated by 'patent illegality appearing on the face of the Award'.

Coming to the most significant provision in the scheme, in form of Section 48, which contemplate that when the enforcement of foreign award is resisted by a party against whom it is made, the burden is on the party to prove that its case falls within the sub-clauses of sub-section (1) or sub- section (2) of Section 48 of the Act of 1996.

In Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra), it is observed by the Apex Court that the New York Convention, 61/168 CARBP-414-18.odt which the Act of 1996 has adopted, has a pro-enforcement bias and unless a party is able to show that its case comes falls within sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 48, the foreign award must be enforced. The grounds contained in Section 48 are watertight and a reading of the said provision would make it manifestly clear that only if the party against whom the enforcement is invoked furnishes to the Court the necessary proof in form of grounds set out in clauses (a) to (e), the award shall not be enforced.

Reading of Section 48 make it evidently clear that no ground outside Section 48 can be looked at and as held in Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra), the grounds are not to be construed expansively, but narrowly.

The relevant observations of the Apex Court in Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra), deserve a reproduction :-

""41. ..... Thus, in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, [""Ssangyong""], it was held: (SCC pp. 172-74, para 45) ""45. After referring to the New York Convention, this Court delineated the scope of enquiry of grounds under Sections 34/48 (equivalent to the grounds under Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act, which was considered by the Court), and held : (Renusagar case, SCC pp.671-72 & 681-82, paras 34-37 & 65-66) ""34. Under the Geneva Convention of 1927, in order to obtain recognition or enforcement of a foreign arbitral award, the requirements of clauses (a) to (e) of Article I had to be fulfilled and in Article II, it was prescribed that even if the conditions laid down in Article I were fulfilled recognition and enforcement of the award would be refused if the court was satisfied in respect of matters mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c). The principles which apply to recognition and enforcement of foreign awards are, in substance, similar to those adopted by the English courts at common law. (See Dicey & Morris, The Conflict of Laws, 11th Edn., Vol. I, p. 578.) It was, however, felt that the Geneva Convention suffered from certain defects which hampered the speedy settlement of disputes through arbitration. The New York Convention seeks to remedy the said defects by providing for a much more simple and effective method of obtaining recognition and enforcement of foreign awards. Under the 62/168 CARBP-414-18.odt New York Convention the party against whom the award is sought to be enforced can object to recognition and enforcement of the foreign award on grounds set out in sub-clauses (a) to (e) of Clause (1) of Article V and the court can, on its own motion, refuse recognition and enforcement of a foreign award for two additional reasons set out in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of Clause (2) of Article V. None of the grounds set out in sub-clauses (a) to (e) of Clause (1) and sub-clauses (a) and
(b) of Clause (2) of Article V postulates a challenge to the award on merits.
35. Albert Jan van den Berg in his treatise The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Judicial Interpretation, has expressed the view:
""It is a generally accepted interpretation of the Convention that the court before which the enforcement of the foreign award is sought may not review the merits of the award. The main reason is that the exhaustive list of grounds for refusal of enforcement enumerated in Article V does not include a mistake in fact or law by the arbitrator. Furthermore, under the Convention the task of the enforcement judge is a limited one. The control exercised by him is limited to verifying whether an objection of a respondent on the basis of the grounds for refusal of Article V(1) is justified and whether the enforcement of the award would violate the public policy of the law of his country. This limitation must be seen in the light of the principle of international commercial arbitration that a national court should not interfere with the substance of the arbitration."" (p. 269)
36. Similarly Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter have said: 'The New York Convention does not permit any review on the merits of an award to which the Convention applies and, in this respect, therefore, differs from the provisions of some systems of national law governing the challenge of an award, where an appeal to the courts on points of law may be permitted."" (Redfern & Hunter, Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration, 2nd Edn., p. 461.)
37. In our opinion, therefore, in proceedings for enforcement of a foreign award under the Foreign Awards Act, 1961, the scope of enquiry before the court in 7 which award is sought to be enforced is limited to grounds mentioned in Section 7 of the Act and does not enable a party to the said proceedings to impeach the award on merits.""",,,,"The Appellant NAFED and Respondent-Alimenta had entered into contract for supply of 5000 metric tonnes of Indian HPS groundnuts, but on account of cyclone, only 1900 metric tonnes was shipped and addendum was executed to the agreement, whereby the period of shipment of the commodity was changed to November-December 1980 for the balance quantity. Clause 14 of the agreement provided that in case of prohibition of export by executive order or by law, the agreement would be treated as cancelled. NAFED had the permission from the Government of India to enter into export for three years i.e. between 1997 - 1980, but no permission under the Export Control Order to carry forward the exports for the season 1979-1980 to the year 1980-1981. Though it sought permission, it was not granted by the Government and an award was passed against NAFED.",,,
,,,"While pronouncing upon the aspect of limitation, one find reference to the arbitration petition filed by the Respondent under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, on 27/11/2008, along with an application for condonation of delay, which was condoned on 10/07/2013, which is held to relate back to the date on which the petition was filed.","Reading of Section 48 make it evidently clear that no ground outside Section 48 can be looked at and as held in Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra), the grounds are not to be construed expansively, but narrowly.",,,,"109. In the facts of the present case, the agreement which contemplated permission to be granted by RBI, unless there is compliance of this stipulation, the agreement is not a lawful contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 since it remains forbidden. It is an admitted position that E-City vide its communication to the Exchange Control Department, RBI, in reference to the ""remittance for lease of capital equipment"", sought approval to make the necessary remittances. In its communication, it clarified that it was desirous of bringing in large 3D format experience for Indian viewers and they have tied with world's leader in this field i.e. IMAX Corporation of Canada and they have to import 3D cinema projection equipments on lease, as this technology is exclusively available with IMAX in the world. By clearly stating that they have to pay US$ 1 million as upfront lease consideration in three tranches (non-refundable) and the last tranche would be due on successful installation of the equipment and the other two shall be advance remittances of US$ 300,000 and further US $ 160,000 needs to be paid for a period of five years from the date when the theater commence its commercial operations and also there was a liability to pay the royalties and annual maintenance charges till the lease expired, when the equipment will have to be exported out of India, the necessary approval was sought.",,,
,,,"82. Though limitation is a mixed question of law and facts, it will shed the said character and would get itself converted into a pure question of law when the foundational fact(s) determining the starting point of limitation is specifically pleaded in the plaint. In such a scenario, if the Court concerned is of the opinion that the point of limitation could be framed as preliminary issue and it warrants postponement of settlement of other issues, till its determination, it may frame the same as a preliminary issue and proceed to deal with the Suit only in accordance with the decision on that issue.","57. The ""pro-enforcement bias"" of the New York Convention, which has found its way in Section 48 has cast the burden on the party/parties objecting to the enforcement instead of party seeking enforcement and it is only when the proof is tendered to the effect, that the parties to the agreement being under some incapacity, or the agreement being invalid under the law 63/168 CARBP-414-18.odt to which the parties have subjected it, the enforcement can be refused.",,,,"On 30/10/2000, SBI (the authorised dealer) addressed a letter to General Manager, Exchange Control Department, RBI 115/168 CARBP-414-18.odt by bringing the facts regarding the proposed remittances and seeking approval of US$ 300,000 in terms of E-City's request towards first tranche, in token of acceptance in view of arrangement proposed to be entered by E-City with IMAX.",,,
,,,"In the wake of the above, since the awards, which are sought to be enforced through the present petition are dated 5/04/2006, 24/08/2007 and 27/03/2008, and as per the law laid down in Vedanta Limited (supra) the limitation period to file the petition for enforcement of the foreign award is held to be governed by Article 137 of Schedule to the Limitation Act, the petition filed under Section 48 of the Act of 1996 in March/ April 2018 is hit by the bar of limitation.","58. The question as to whether a non-parties to the agreement can raise such an objection is also well settled in Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra). By a bare look at Section 47, which speaks of an arbitral award on differences between ""persons"" and specifically, since Section 48(1)(a) refers only to the ""parties"" to the agreement referred to in Section 44(a), it is concluded that to include non-parties to the agreement, by introducing the word ""person"" would run contrary to the express language of Section 48(1)(a).",,,,"A suit filed by Mr.David was decreed, declaring that he was the absolute owner of the suit property. The appellant, however, filed an appeal before the High Court of Karnataka against the judgment and decree with reference to the validity of the gift deed and the supplementary gift deed, both executed in favour of respondent No.1 in respect of the large property. The High Court negatived the challenge and held that lack of permission under Section 31 of FERA did not render the subject gift deed void much less illegal and unenforceable.",,,
,,,"ISSUE NO.D Whether the transaction contemplated under the Master Agreement is violative of public policy of India, making the Awards unenforceable under Section 48(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996","59. The scope of Section 48 of the Act is also exhaustively dealt with in case of Vijay Karia & Ors. Vs. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi SRL & Ors.29, with specific reference to one of the ground stipulated therein being the enforcement of the award to be contrary to the public policy in India and as to what would mean by ""public policy"" and though I would be referring 29 (2020) 11 SCC 1 64/168 CARBP-414-18.odt to the relevant observations to that effect, when I deal with the contention of Mr.Seksaria that the agreement was unenforceable, being not in accordance with the public policy in India, for the present, the relevant observations as regards the scope of Section 48 from the decision, deserve a reproduction :-

""50. The US cases show that given the ""pro-enforcement bias""
of the New York Convention, which has been adopted in Section 48 of the Arbitration Act, 1996-the burden of proof on parties seeking enforcement has now been placed on parties objecting to enforcement and not the other way around in the guise of public policy of the country involved, foreign awards cannot be set aside by second guessing the arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement of the parties; the challenge procedure in the primary jurisdiction gives more leeway to courts to interfere with an award than the narrow restrictive grounds contained in the New York Convention when a foreign award's enforcement is resisted.""

It is thus well settled, that Section 48, is hedged with pro- enforcement bias and unless the Respondent No.1 is able to show that its case falls within Section 48(1) or 48(2), the foreign award must be enforced.

Before executing the gift deed, she had executed an agreement for sale in favour of Mr.R.P.David, father of the appellant, whereunder the title deed of the schedule property was delivered by her to Mr.David.","61. On the present Petition being filed, the Respondents raised a preliminary objection of it is being barred by limitation and on 13/11/2019, the objection was held to be not sustainable, by holding that Petition filed by IMAX is within the prescribed period of limitation.

A careful reading of the order dated 13/11/2019 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court (Coram :

G.S.Kulkarni, J.) would disclose that the learned Judge has taken into consideration the wholesole background facts, including the Petition filed by E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt.
66/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Ltd. under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, calling in question the awards, coupled with the application for condonation of delay, when an objection was raised about the maintainability of the Petition.
The Apex Court finally decided the Petition on 10/03/2017, inter alia, holding that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the Petition under Section 34, as the challenge was to the foreign awards and, this step resulted in institution of the present petition, by invoking Sections 47, 48 and 49 of the Act of 1996 on 02/04/2018, seeking enforcement and execution of the awards in question.
Respondent No.1 invoked the provision of Article 137 under the Schedule to the Limitation Act, while it raised an objection about it being time barred.
Referring to Article 137, a residuary clause, which was captioned as, ""any other application for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this division"", the period of limitation start running when the right to apply accrues, the limitation prescribed being of three years. Reference was also made to Article 136, with the description as, "" for the execution of any decree (other than a decree granting a mandatory injunction) or order of any civil court"", which prescribe the period of limitation as twelve years.
On considering the rival contentions advanced, with E- City specifically raising an objection that there is no application for condonation of delay filed by the Petitioner, the contention was recorded to the effect that even assuming that this Court was wrongly approached under Section 34 67/168 CARBP-414-18.odt proceedings in the year 2008, ultimately the issue was decided by the Apex Court on 10/03/2017, holding that the proceeding filed by Respondent No.1 under Section 34 were not maintainable and the pendency of these proceedings in no manner could have saved the limitation prescribed under Article 137. The contention that seeking enforcement of an award is governed by substantive provision contained in form of Sections 47 to 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the party holding a foreign award cannot sleep over its enforcement/decreetal right arising under the award and cannot seek its enforcement merely because there are some proceedings filed by the award debtor, assailing the awards before a Court, which was not competent to entertain such proceedings.
Per contra, the Petitioner contended that the Respondents objection about applicability of Article 137 of the Limitation Act is not correct, since the foreign award itself is required to be accepted as a decree and the proceedings filed by the Petitioner under Sections 47 and 48 of the Act of 1996, are to be considered as proceedings for enforcement and execution of foreign awards.
It was, therefore, contended that the case of the Petitioner would be governed by Article 136 of the Limitation Act and not by Article 137, as the former provided for execution of any decree or order of any Civil Court and prescribed the period of limitation of twelve years from the time, when the decree or order becomes enforceable.",,,,"116. E-City submitted the expert legal opinion on the RBI and FEMA regime, of Mr.Akshay Chudasama, Indian qualified Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales, where he opined that given that the authorised dealer has sought prior approval to make the remittance, E-City could not have made the remittance without prior approval.",,,
,,,"120. This issue of requiring mandatory approval of Reserve Bank of India, is actually determined by me as the bone of contention between the Parties, since the objection to the enforceability of the Awards is raised on the ground that the Awards are passed in contravention to the fundamental policy in India and here the FEMA Act and Regulations/Circulars under the said Act. The Arbitral Tribunal ought to have focused upon the specific stand raised by E-City in its statement of defence qua the requirement of mandatory 125/168 CARBP-414-18.odt approval of Reserve Bank of India, but unfortunately this was dealt with in a routine manner without focusing upon the same in depth. The Arbitral Tribunal has failed to consider the prime issue whether the Agreement in question is forbidden by law based upon the principal of private International Law viz. a contractual obligation which can be invalidated by Exchange Control Registration if it part of the law in the place of its performance.","62. In this background, the short question which fell for consideration, as to whether the Petition was filed within the prescribed limitation, came to be decided and while the learned Single Judge clearly accepted that the enforcement and execution can form part of the same proceedings and, therefore, found it appropriate to invoke Article 136 under the Limitation Act and concluded thus :-
""26. It is thus beyond a pale of doubt that enforcement and execution can form part of the same proceedings. If this be so then certainly Article 136 under the Limitation Act becomes relevant. If the argument of non applicability of Article 136 as urged on behalf of the respondent is accepted, it would be contrary to the principle of law as laid down by the Supreme Court in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd. (supra) apart from deeply damaging the decreetal interest of the award creditors apart from being contrary to the object of Section 47 to 49 of the Arbitration Act.
27. In fact the above legal position now stands reinforced as seen from a recent decision of the Supreme Court in M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar SA, the Supreme Court taking note of the decisions in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd. (supra) and Thyssen Stahlunion GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) has held that the observations of the Supreme Court in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd. (supra) that ""the only difference as found is that while under the Foreign Awards Act a decree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree."" to mean that the expression ""stamped""
means ""regarded"" This means that the foreign award is to be regarded as a decree. The following observations of the Supreme Court in paragraph 19 read thus:-

""One sentence in Fuerst Day Lawson (supra) reads, ""[T]he only difference as found is that while under the Foreign Awards Act a decree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree."" This sentence does not lead to the conclusion, following the judgment in Thyssen Stahlunion GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd., (1999) 9 SCC 334, that under the 1996 Act, a foreign award is considered to be stamped already. All that this sentence means is that the foreign award is to be regarded as a decree. The expression ""stamped"" means ""regarded"". This judgment also does not carry us much further.""",,,,"This opinion from Mr.Chudasama, a witness competent to depose, went un-controverted, as he was not cross- examined.",,,
,,,,"63. Even the Petition was tested by applying the provision of Article 137 and an inference was drawn in the wake of the 69/168 CARBP-414-18.odt documentary evidence with its chronology that the Petition is not barred by law of limitation, by recording as under :-

""28. Now coming to the contention as urged on behalf of the respondents, the main thrust of the respondents' argument is the decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Noy Vallesina Engineering Spa v/s. Jindal Drugs Limited (supra). In my opinion considering the facts of the present case and as noted above, that the Supreme Court on 10 March 2017 set aside the order passed by this Court holding that the Section 34 petition filed by the respondents was not maintainable and the present proceedings being filed on 2 April 2018, even by applicability of the provisions of Article 137 of the Limitation Act, the petition is not barred by limitation. In any case, applying the principle of law as laid down in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd. (supra) and M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar SA (supra), the Court cannot overlook the prayers as made by the petitioner which are in the nature of a combined petition namely for enforcement and for execution of the award. As observed above a broader view is required to be taken to advance the object and intention of the provisions of the Arbitration Act and not a hard technical approach as urged by the respondents that the petition be held as time barred, by applying Article 137 of the Limitation Act in the absence of a delay condonation application and the delay being condoned. This contention of the respondents militates against from what the Supreme Court has now further clarified in M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar SA (supra)that when it was observed in Furest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd (supra) that the Foreign award is already stamped as a decree, it means that ""the foreign award is to be regarded as a decree."" In view of this clear position in law there is no manner of doubt and more particularly as seen the prayers as made in the petition that this petition cannot be held to be time barred, as contended on behalf of the respondents.""",,,,"However, in the award, the Tribunal rejected the argument that the clause concerning RBI rendered the obligations unenforceable, by recording that clause 14 for that matter does not say that the permission of the bank is a condition precedent to the enforcement of the agreement, on the contrary all that clause 14 does, is refer to the obligation of the parties to negotiate a change in the structure, should the RBI not approve it. It is concluded that it was not an escape clause for E-City to avoid any liability, but it was a clause indicating that the parties would restructure their arrangement within the framework of the Master Agreement, if the RBI raise concern.",,,
,,,,"64. The order dated 13/11/2019 to the above effect was challenged by IMAX and during its pendency, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Vedanta Limited (supra), by taking note of this order passed by the learned Single Judge on 13/11/2019, reached a conclusion that a foreign award was a decree and, therefore, Article 136 of the Limitation Act is applicable for its enforcement.

70/168 CARBP-414-18.odt The issue of limitation for filing an enforcement/ execution application of foreign award under Section 47 of the Act of 1996, was deliberated upon, in the wake of the divergent views being taken by different High Courts with respect to the period of limitation.

In making reference to the various decisions, the decision of the learned Single Judge of Bombay High Court in Noy Vallesina Engg. Spa Vs. Jindal Drugs Ltd. 30, Imax Corporation Vs. E-City Entertainment (India) (P) Ltd. as well as the decisions of the Madras High Court and the Delhi High Court were taken note of.

As regards the view taken in Imax (supra), it was noted that another Single Judge of the Bombay High Court, followed the Judgment in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. and held that since the foreign award is already stamped as a decree, the award holder may apply for enforcement, after steps are taken for execution of award under Sections 47 and 48 of the Act of 1996, as in one proceedings, there may be different stages, the first stage being the Court would require to decide on the enforceability of the award, having regard to the requirement of the provision and, thereafter, proceed to take steps for its execution and, therefore, Article 136 would be applicable for enforcement of a foreign award.",,,,"117. Even Mr.David Berman, the witness on behalf of IMAX, gave a clear admission that in respect of additional payments, 123/168 CARBP-414-18.odt it is conceded by RBI to be extraordinary commercial borrowings and if it is so then definitely the FEMA and the restrictions imposed by RBI as well as the Central Government are expected to be complied with, having been held to be mandatory.",,,
,,,,"65. Their Lordships of the Apex Court, in the wake of the conflicting pronouncements, noted that the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 does not specify any period of limitation for filing application for enforcement/execution of foreign award, 30 2006 SCC OnLine Bom 545 71/168 CARBP-414-18.odt though Section 43 provide that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations, as it applies to proceedings in Court.

It is recorded that Limitation Act, 1963 does not contain any specific provision for enforcement of a foreign award and Articles 136 and 137 fall within the third division of the Schedule, and Article 136 provides that the period of limitation for the execution of any decree or order of a ""civil court"" is twelve years from the date when the decree or order becomes enforceable.

Article 137 was referred to as residuary provision, prescribing the limitation of three years from the point of time, when the right to apply accrues.",,,,"A party, in an adversary system deserve an opportunity to challenge by cross-examination, the evidence of any witness of the opposing party, so as to impact the witnesses's credibility, so that his evidence shall not be accepted on that point and this is a well recognized matter of fairness in legal proceedings.

A Party is disentitled to impugn the witness or another parties witness, if he has not asked appropriate question enabling the witness to deal with the same.",,,
,,,,,,,,"The Agreement clearly contemplated prior approval of Reserve Bank of India, but the Award proceed on the basis that there is no evidence to prove that Reserve Bank of India would not have given permission, without testing the assertion of E-City that RBI never granted permission. Mr. Chudasma, the witness of E-City has unequivocally stated; ""......... Given by, that the Authorized Dealer State Bank of India itself had sought prior Reserve Bank of India approval for remittance of monies under the LOI and it was not possible for E-City to have made the remittances without prior approval of RBI."" The Tribunal ought to have, therefore, considered the issue by taking into consideration the above statement surfacing from the evidence of Mr. Chudasama which went un-contraverted.",,,
,,,,"66. In light of the said scheme, further observations of the Apex Court in paragraph 69 deserve a reproduction :-

""69. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 creates a statutory fiction for the limited purpose of enforcement of a ""domestic award"" as a decree of the court, even though it is otherwise an award in an arbitral proceeding. By this deeming fiction, a domestic award is deemed to be a decree of the court, even though it is as such not a decree passed by a civil court. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot be considered to be a ""court"", and the arbitral proceedings are not civil proceedings. The deeming fiction is restricted to treat the award as a decree of the court for the purposes of execution, even though it is, as a matter of fact, only an award in arbitral proceeding. In Paramjeet Singh Patheja V. ICDS Ltd., this Court in the context of a domestic award, held that the fiction is not intended to make an award a decree for all purposes, or under all statutes, whether State or Central. It is a legal fiction which must be limited to the purpose for which it was created. Paras 39 and 42 of the judgment in Paramjeet Singh Patheja read as : (SCC pp.345-46) ""39. Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1899 provides for ""enforcing""
the award as if it were a decree. Thus a final award, without actually being followed by a decree (as was later provided by Section 17 of the Arbitration Act of 1940), could be enforced i.e. executed in the same manner as a decree. For this limited purpose of enforcement, the provisions of CPC were made available for realising the money awarded. However, the award remained an award and did not become a decree either as defined in CPC and much less so far the purposes of 72/168 CARBP-414-18.odt an entirely different statute such as the Insolvency Act are concerned.

** ** **

42. The words ""as if"" demonstrate that award and decree or order are two different things. The legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of enforcement as a decree. The fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes under all statutes,whether State or Central.""

(emphasis supplied)",,,,"The question so arose, when Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths and their youngest son went on a package holiday, which included package of meals. Mr. Griffith suffered a serious stomach upset which left him in long term problem and he sued the travel company. At trial, Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths gave uncontested evidence as to the fact. The evidence of an expert was also lead, who expressed an opinion, that on the balance of probabilities the food or drink served at the hotel was the cause for Mr. Griffiths woes.",,,
,,,,"67. Further observations leading to a conclusion in paragraph 76 to the effect that the period of limitation for filing a petition for enforcement of a foreign award under Sections 47 and 49 would be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is supported by the following reasoning :-

""72. Foreign awards are not decrees of an Indian civil court. By a legal fiction, Section 49 provides that a foreign award, after it is granted recognition and enforcement under Section 48, would be deemed to be a decree of ""that court"" for the limited purpose of enforcement. The phrase ""that court"" refers to the court which has adjudicated upon the petition filed under Sections 47 and 49 for enforcement of the foreign award. In our view, Article 136 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable for the enforcement/execution of a foreign awards, since it is not a decree of a civil court in India.
73. The enforcement of a foreign award as a deemed decree of the High Court concerned [as per the amended Explanation to Section 47 by Act 3 of 2016 confers exclusive jurisdiction on the High Court for execution of foreign awards] would be covered by the residuary provision i.e. Article 137 of the Limitation Act. A three- Judge Bench of this Court in Kerala SEB V. T.P.Kunhaliumma held that the phrase ""any other application"" in Article 137 cannot be interpreted on the principle of ejusdem generis to be applications under the Civil Procedure Code. The phrase ""any other application""
used in Article 137 would include petitions within the word ""applications"", filed under any special enactment. This would be evident from the definition of ""application"" under Section 2(b) of the Limitation Act, which includes a petition. Article 137 stands in isolation from all other Articles in Part I of the Third Division of the Limitation Act, 1963.

74. The exclusion of an application filed under any of the provisions of Order 21 CPC from the purview of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, was brought in by the present Limitation Act, 1963. Under the previous Limitation Act, 1908 there were varying 73/168 CARBP-414-18.odt periods of limitation prescribed by Articles 182 and 183 of the said Act, as well as Section 48 of CPC, 1908. Article 182 provided that the period of limitation for execution of a decree or order of any civil court was 3 years, and in case where a certified copy of the decree or order was registered, the period of limitation was 6 years. Article 183 provided that the period of limitation to enforce a decree or order of a High Court was 6 years. Section 48 CPC (which has since been repealed by Section 28 of the Limitation Act of 1963) provided that the period of limitation for execution a decree was 12 years.

75. The Law Commission in its 3rd Report dated 21-7-1956 noted that different time-limits were prescribed for filing an application for execution of decrees or orders of civil courts. It was recommended that the time-limit should be absolute, and there should be no scope for any further extension of time by acknowledgments. There was no justification for making a distinction between decrees or orders passed by the High Court in exercise of original civil jurisdiction, and other decrees. The maximum period of limitation for the execution of a decree or order of any civil court was fixed at twelve years in the new Limitation Act, 1963 from the date when the decree or order became enforceable. In this background, the present Limitation Act, 1963 excludes any application filed under Order 21 from the purview of Section 5 of the Act, with the object that execution of decrees should be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible. The period of limitation for execution of the decree of a civil court is now uniformly fixed at the maximum period of 12 years for decrees of civil courts.""",,,,examination the evidence of any witness of the opposing party on a material point which he or she wishes to submit to the court should not be accepted. That rule extends to both witnesses as to fact and expert witnesses.,,,
,,,,"68. Another tenacious justification offered in support of the conclusion drawn is worded as below :-

""77. The application under Sections 47 and 49 for enforcement of the foreign award, is a substantive petition filed under the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is a well-settled position that the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code. The application under Section 47 is not an application filed under any of the provisions of Order 21 CPC, 1908. The application is filed before the appropriate High Court for enforcement, which would take recourse to the provisions of Order 21 CPC only for the purposes of execution of the foreign award as a deemed decree. The bar contained in Section 5, which excludes an application filed under any of the provisions of Order 21 CPC, would not be applicable to a substantive petition filed under the Arbitration Act, 1996. Consequently, a party may file an application under Section 5 for condonation of delay, if required in the facts and circumstances of the case.""",,,,"(vi) Cross-examination gives the witness the opportunity to explain or clarify his or her evidence. That opportunity is particularly important when the opposing party intends to accuse the witness of 42 (1863) 6 R 67 128/168 CARBP-414-18.odt dishonesty, but there is no principled basis for confining the rule to cases of dishonesty.""",,,
,,,,"69. The conundrum as regards the limitation period to be made applicable to the enforcement petition under Sections 47 and 49 has been put to rest by holding that the period of limitation prescribed by Article 136 of the Limitation Act shall be made applicable, but on sufficient grounds being shown to condone the delay in filing the enforcement/execution application, the delay is allowed to be condoned.
Admittedly, the present Petition is not supported by any such application for condonation of delay.",,,,"122. By reading of the aforesaid principles, which has also found its way in the Indian Jurisprudence, being recognized as a principal of natural justice, if there is no cross- examination on a particular point which has surfaced on record through the testimony of a particular witness, in that case the said statement being uncontroverted deserve to be accepted and admitted in evidence. Whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his essential and material case in cross-examination, it must follow that the testimony cannot be disputed at all.",,,
,,,,"70. Dealing with the objection that the Petition having been filed after five years, is barred by law of limitation, Mr.Chinoy has urged that once a point of limitation as a preliminary issue in the very same proceedings is decided by an order of this Court on 13/11/2019, holding that the Petition was within limitation, it is not open to E-City to once again raise the same contention. In any case, Mr.Chinoy has urged that the learned Single Judge has accepted the principal submission of the Petitioner that the limitation would be governed by Article 136 and he also accepted the alternative submission on behalf of IMAX that even Article 137 is applied, which has prescribed three years as period of limitation, from the point of time, when the right to apply accrues, it was still within limitation, by recording that as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade Private Limited Vs. AMCI (India) Private Limited & Anr. 31, the filing of Petition under Section 34 by E-City, operated as a stay on the enforcement of the award and it was only on 10/03/2017, when the Hon'ble Supreme Court dismissed the Section 34 Petition, 31 (2009) 17 SCC 796 75/168 CARBP-414-18.odt the enforcement and execution proceedings could have been entertained on behalf of IMAX.
E-City preferred Special Leave Petition before the Apex Court against the Judgment dated 13/11/2019, which was dismissed on 18/10/2022, which was subsequent to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Vedanta Limited (supra) against which a review petition was filed, but even the same was dismissed on 16/08/2023. Therefore, according to Mr.Chinoy, issue of limitation stands concluded by the Judgment dated 13/11/2019 and it is not open for E-City to re-
open the said issue.",,,,"124. When the admissions coming from the witness of E-City was not controverted by subjecting him to cross-examination, 129/168 CARBP-414-18.odt I find that the Tribunal derived an inference contrary to what has been deposed by the witness, without affording a chance to explain or clarify the said statement, has definitely resulted into a loss of fair hearing as Mr. Chudasama had unequivocally stated that it was not possible for E-City to have made the remittances without prior approval of Reserve Bank of India, but without going for the cross-examination, the Tribunal has questioned this testimony, expressed doubt and derived at a finding that it was not a mandatory requirement and it was not refused, which definitely has resulted into perversity in its finding.",,,
,,,,"The law of limitation is based on the maximum Interest Reipublicae Ut Sit Finis Litium. It is a general principle of general welfare that end should be put to a litigation and the principle is founded on the public policy. Section 3 of the Limitation Act makes it imperative for the Court to dismiss any application, filed beyond the period of limitation, although the point of limitation may be raised as one of the defence. It is only when sufficient cause is shown, the period of limitation is permitted to be extended, as contemplated under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.",,,,"126. In utter contrast, in Para 54, the Tribunal record that according the evidence of Mr. Burman, the Tribunal has no hesitation in accepting that the Reserve Bank of India has given permission for remittances of funds pursuant to other contracts, which other Indian parties have entered into and, therefore, there could have been no difficulty with the RBI in this respect, the contracts being structured in from of Sale and Purchase, rather than IMAX's customary form of lease.",,,
,,,,"It is, therefore, when a sufficient cause is shown, the Court may be persuaded to accept the explanation offered and deem it appropriate to condone the delay and entertain the cause, despite it being lodged before the Court beyond the period prescribed for limitation.",,,,"128. I have perused the orders passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, in the Company Petitions, where sanction was sought from the Court to the scheme of demerger under Section 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.",,,
,,,,"72. Another angle to the law of limitation is also to be kept in mind, being on expiration of period of limitation prescribed for instituting the proceedings or making an Appeal, a right accrues in favour of other party, on account of the lapse of time and this right shall not be lightheartedly disturbed. The proof of sufficient cause is a condition precedent for exercise of power vested in the Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act and the significant consideration would be the diligence of the party and its bona fide.",,,,"It is also specifically stated that the process for re- organization of business of E-City i.e. Respondent No.1 and 133/168 CARBP-414-18.odt demerger of real estate business of the Company was in pursuant to the Direct Automatic Root FDI Policy as a business decision and after receipt of advise of experts, such as APMG and ERNST and Young, this process kick started on 07/06/2005 on which date the Board of Directors of E-City passed a resolution to make the Company FDI compliant and this was much prior to the statement of case by IMAX and even much prior to the passing of Partial Final Award on liability on 09/02/2006. The incorporation of Respondent No.2 was immediately after the announcement of FDI Policy, whereas, incorporation of Respondent No.3 was after the Board Meeting dated 07/06/2005, and it is noted by me that only upon sufficient disclosures and statutory compliances being ensured, the High Court allowed the prayer of demerger in the company petitions in accordance with the Companies Act and the Rules thereunder.",,,
,,,,"73. The bar of limitation, as set out in Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963, goes to the root of the matter and irrespective of whether the objection has been raised or not, the Court is cast with an independent duty to look into the aspect of limitation. In Noharlal Verma Vs. District Co- Operative Central Bank Limited, Jagdalpur32, the said principle has been succinctly set out in the following words :-

""32. Now, limitation goes to the root of the matter. If a suit,appeal or application is barred by limitation, a court or an adjudicating authority has no jurisdiction, power or authority to entertain such suit, appeal or application and to decide iton merits.
33. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 reads as under :-
""3. Bar of limitation.-(1) Subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, an application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence.""
(emphasis supplied) Bare reading of the aforesaid provision leaves no room for doubt that if a suit is instituted, appeal is preferred or application is made after the prescribed period, it has to be dismissed even though no such plea has been raised or defence has been set up. In other words, even in absence of such plea by the defendant, respondent or opponent, the court or authority must dismiss such suit, appeal or application, if it is satisfied that the suit, appeal or application is barred by limitation.""",,,,"129. I find substance in the submission of Mr. Seksaria that no notice was required to be given to the Petitioner as it was not a creditor of E-City and it is not necessary to give notice to the contingent creditors. In fact, right of the Petitioner to recover 'damages' was crystalized only when the final Award was passed by the ICC Tribunal and this event occurred on 24/04/2008, which is almost a year after the completion of demerger, through the process contemplated in India. It is worth to note that the declaratory Award cannot be enforced without quantification and, therefore, the final Award dated 24/04/2008 is the one which is sought to be enforced. The annual report of E-city for the financial year 2006,2007 made disclosure of liability towards IMAX and the Petitioner and the pending proceedings. The annual report for the year ending on 31/03/2006 formed part of the Company Petitions filed before this Court for approval of demerger scheme of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 and, therefore, when an order is passed by a competent Court, permitting the de-merger, there can be no challenge raised to the same.",,,
,,,,"75. Whether a decision on question of law operates as res judicata was the subject matter of the determination before the Apex Court as early in 1970 in Mathura Prasasd Bajoo Jaiswal & Ors. (supra), in relation to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and what would constitute res judicata, a doctrine belonging to domain of procedure, was deliberated.

The pertinent observations in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the decision read thus :-

""6. The authorities on the question whether a decision on a question of law operates as res judicata disclose widely differing views. In some cases it was decided that a decision on a question of law can never be res judicata in a subsequent proceedings between the same Parties : Parthasardhi Ayyangar v. Chinnakrishna Ayyangar; Chamanlal v. Bapubhai; and Kanta Devi v. Kalawati. On the other hand Aikman, J., in Chandi Prasad v. Maharaja Mahendra Singh , held that a decision on a question of law is always res judicata. But as observed by Rankin, C.J., in Tarini Charan Bhattacharjee v. Kedar Nath Haldar :
""Question of law are of all kinds and cannot be dealt with a though they were all the same. Questions of procedure, questions affecting jurisdiction, questions of limitation, may all be questions of law. In such questions the rights of parties are not the only matter for consideration.""
We may analyse the illustrative cases relating to questions of law, decisions on which may be deemed res judicata in subsequent proceedings........

7. Where the law is altered since the earlier decision, the earlier decision will not operate as res judicata between the same parties :

Tarini Charan Bhattacharjee's case (supra). It is obvious that the matter in issue in a subsequent proceeding is not the same as in the previous proceeding, because the law interpreted is different.""",,,,"Though Mr.Seksaria has attempted to raise certain objection about its confidentiality, it being a privileged document, which predate the approved scheme presented before its Board of Directors, being placed before the Court at Ontario and some doubt is raised about the manner in which it has been procured, I do not intend to delve deep into this aspect, but at this stage deem it appropriate to only note that the Petitioner was aware of the proposed scheme of demerger, but chose to maintain silent and now for the first time, the scheme of demerger is called in question. However, with the explanation offered by Mr. Chinoy, that the Petitioner has no intention to raise challenge to the demerger scheme and even the impleadment of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 is for the reason that the Petitioner perceived it as an attempt to divest E-City of its assets so as to defeat the Award, I deem it appropriate to close this issue at this stage, as I have noted that it is by two orders passed by this Court in the Company Petition, the scheme of demerger between Respondent Nos.1 and 2 and Respondent Nos.1 and 3 has been approved and the schedule to the scheme clearly reflect the book value of the assets vis- a-vis liabilities of the Company and, therefore, there is no gainsay in the submission advanced on behalf of the Petitioner that the whole object of the de-merger scheme was to strip 136/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Respondent No.1 of its assets to avoid the liabilities under the declaratory Award and to render its enforcement infructuous.",,,
,,,,"76. Holding that the question of jurisdiction of the Court, or of procedure, or a pure question of law unrelated to the right of the parties to a previous suit, is not res judicata in the subsequent suit, the observations of Rankin, C.J. in Tarini Charan Bhattacharjee v. Kedar Nath Haldar 33, were reproduced :-
""The object of the doctrine of res judicata is not to fasten upon parties special principles of law as applicable to them inter se, but to ascertain their rights and the facts upon which these rights directly and substantially depend; and to prevent this ascertainment from becoming nugatory by precluding the parties from reopening or recontesting that which has been finally decided.""
In paragraph 10 of the law report, Justice J.C. Shah concluded that a question relating to jurisdiction of a Court cannot be deemed to have been finally determined by an erroneous decision of the Court and if by an erroneous interpretation of the statute, the Court holds that it has no jurisdiction, the question would not operate as res judicata. Similarly, by an erroneous decision, if the Court assumes jurisdiction, which it did not possess under the statute, the question cannot operate as res judicata between the same parties, whether the cause of action in the subsequent litigation is the same or otherwise.",,,,"It is, after this reporting, the partial Award on jurisdiction and quantum was passed by ICC Tribunal on 24.08.2007 and, therefore, the contention of Mr. Chinoy that the scheme of demerger was intended to defraud IMAX, the Petitioner, cannot be accepted.",,,
,,,,"The question relating to limitation thus cannot be deemed to have been determined by an erroneous decision of the Court and such decision shall not operate as res judicata at a subsequent stage between the same parties because if it is considered to be conclusive, it will assume the status of a special rule that is applicable to the Petitioner and the Respondent No.1, relating to the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the application in derogation of the rule declared by the legislature that Article 137 of the Schedule of the 81/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Limitation Act and Section 3 of the Limitation Act and, particularly, this is what the law laid down by the Apex Court in Vedanta Limited (supra), concluding that the foreign awards are not decrees of the Indian Civil Court and the application for its execution would be an application not covered under any other Article of the Limitation Act, and, hence, would be covered by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.",,,,"The Petitioner had a knowledge of the demerger of Respondent No.1 when it approached the Supreme Court of New York as an authenticated true copy of the order dated 31/08/2007 passed by the Bombay High Court in Company Petition No.407/2007 approving the scheme of demerger between Respondent Nos.1 and 3 was annexed alongwith the proceedings and the certified copy of the same was obtained by the Petitioner on 01/11/2007. Since the Petitioner continued to remain silent despite having knowledge of the demerger scheme from 2008, after a gross delay of 11 years, there cannot be an indirect challenge to the scheme of demerger as the orders have already attained finality.

                                 137/168                CARBP-414-18.odt

,,,,"It is in these circumstances, while concluding that enforcement and execution can form part of the same proceedings, Article 136 under the Limitation Act is invoked.",,,,"He would candidly submit that the Respondent Nos.2 to 4 have been joined at the execution stage of the awards as the respondents have, during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings, divested the assets and properties of Respondent No.1 to the Respondent Nos.2 and 3 Companies through the two schemes of De-merger, leaving E-City Entertainment (L) Pvt Ltd with a meager asset of approx. 700,000 US$. The Respondent No.1 face an accusation that this improper diversion of its assets to the Respondent No.2 i.e. E-City Real 138/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Estate Pvt. Ltd. took place in June 2007 after the 'liability award' dated 09/03/2006 was made and the improper diversion of balance assets of E-City to the Respondent No.3, E- City Project Construction Pvt Ltd, took place in August 2007 after both, the liability award' dated 09/07/2007 and the 'quantum award' dated 24/08/2007 were pronounced. As far as Respondent No.4 E-City Investment and Holding Co. Pvt. Ltd is concerned, it is the holding Company which holds more than 98% shares of E-City Real Estate and E-City Project Construction Pvt.Ltd, and which along with, E-City Real estates holds 99% of E-City Entertainments.",,,
,,,,"80. Reliance is placed on the well settled position of law as set out in Fiza Developers(supra) to the effect that until disposal of the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, there is an implied prohibition on enforcement of the arbitral award as the very filing and pendency of the application under Section 34, in effect operated as stay on the enforcement of the award.

Laying emphasis on the provisions of the Arbitration Act, prior to its amendment by the 2015 Amendment Act (with effect from 23/10/2015), the observations in paragraphs 19 and 20 in Fiza Developers (supra) were reproduced in support of the plea that filing and pendency of an application under Section 34, in effect, operate as a stay to the enforcement of the award.

My attention is invited to the decision of the Apex Court in case of Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. (supra), wherein it is categorically held and declared that there was never an automatic stay on enforcement of an award, upon filing of a petition under Section 34 of the Act, either pre or post to 2015 amendment to the Act, and the decision in case of Fiza Developers (supra) was expressly over ruled by declaring it to be per incuriam including paragraph 20 thereof, which formed the basis of the incidental observations in the order dated 13/11/2019 as regards applicability of the limitation prescribed under Article 137 of the Limitation Act.

It would be appropriate to reproduce relevant observations in Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. (supra), to the following effect:

85/168 CARBP-414-18.odt

32. When this Court speaks of 'the mandatory language of Section 34' of the Arbitration Act, 1996 obviously what is meant is the language of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, as noted by National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd.vs. Lloyds Insulation India Ltd. (2005) 2 SCC 367 (in paragraph 6). In Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade (P) Ltd. v. AMCI (Budia) (P) Ltd., this Court held: [Fiza Developers & Inter-Trade case, SCC p. 801, para

20. Section 36 provides that an award shall be enforced in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court, but only on the expiry of the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 or such application having been made, only after it has been refused. Thus until the disposal of the application under Section 34 of the Act, there is an implied prohibition of enforcement of the arbitral award. The very filing and pendency of an application under Section 34, in effect, operates as a stay of the enforcement of the award.""

33. To state that an award when challenged under Section 34 becomes unexecutable merely by virtue of such challenge being made because of the language of Section 36 is plainly incorrect. As has been pointed out hereinabove, Section 36 was enacted for a different purpose. When read with Section 35, all that Section 36 states is that enforcement of a final award will be under the CPC, and in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. In fact, this is how Section 36 has been read by a three-Judge Bench in Leela Hotels Ltd. v. Housing & Urban Development Corpn. Ltd. as follows: (SCC p. 313, para 45) ""45. Regarding the question as to whether the award of the learned arbitrator tantamounts to a decree or not, the language used in Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, makes it very clear that such an award has to be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure in the same manner as it were a decree of the court. The said language leaves no room for doubt as to the manner in which the award of the learned arbitrator was to be accepted.""

38. Thus, the reasoning of the judgments in NALCOS, and Fiza Developer Inter-Trade (P) Ltd. being per incuriam in not noticing Sections 9, 35 and the second part of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, do not commend themselves to us and do not state the law correctly. The fact that NALCO has been followed in National Buildings Construction Corpn. Ltd. v. Lloyds Insulation (India) Ltd. (supra) does not take us any further, as National Buildings Construction Corpn. Ltd. in following NALCO, a per incuriam judgment, also does not state the law correctly. Thus, it is clear that the automatic stay of an award, as laid down by these decisions, is incorrect. The resultant position is that Section 36 - even as originally enacted- is not meant to do away with Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, but is really meant to do away with the two bites at the cherry doctrine in the context of awards made in India, 86/168 CARBP-414-18.odt and the fact that enforcement of a final award, when read with Section 35, is to be under the CPC, treating the award as if it were a decree of the court.",,,,"133. The legal scenario flowing from the decision, has acknowledged that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, is also applicable in execution proceedings, when the Company is a creature of the group and it has masked itself in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equity or when it is a mere cloak or sham and in truth, the business was being carried out by one person and not by a company as a separate entity, or when the Companies are intricably interlinked corporate entities. The Corporate veil can be lifted in cases where the Court from the material on record derive an inference that the judgment debtor is trying to defeat the execution of the award and in such a situation, if Respondent Nos.2 and 3 are only the cloaks and mask behind which the Respondent No.1 attempted to operate, so as to avoid its liability under the awards and the entire assets were transferred only with this intention, then, in such exceptional circumstances, it is permissible to pierce the corporate veil 140/168 CARBP-414-18.odt and the law in this regard is, by this time, well settled.",,,
,,,,"81. In the wake of the aforesaid, since the judgment in Fiza Developers (supra), which contemplated that in enforcement of the arbitral award, by the very filing and pendency of an application under Section 34, amount to stay on the enforcement, has lost its ground and the order dated 13/11/2019 which is based on Fiza Developers (supra) also cannot sustain.

In the wake of the aforesaid, the said order cannot operate as res judicata between the parties as Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. (Supra) has declared the law that there was never an automatic stay on enforcement of an award, upon filing of a petition under Section 34 of the Act and the incidental observation in relation to Article 137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, in the order dated 13/11/2019, has also lost its grounds, though I am of the firm view that the reference to Article 137, and its applicability was only a non- incidental discussion. The observations in the order dated 13/11/2019, in so far as Article 137 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act is concerned being only incidental observations, as the objection raised by the Respondent No.1 and the determination was focused upon the applicability of the Article 136 and therefore, I find substance in the submission of Mr.Seksaria, that the order dated 13/11/2019, cannot operate as res judicata or issue estoppel.",,,,"134. E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt.Ltd, Respondent No.2 was incorporated on 29/4/2005, a year later, after the claim was instituted by IMAX before the ICC, whereas Respondent No.3, E-City Project Construction was incorporated was 8/6/2005.",,,
,,,,"83. In Sukhbiri Devi & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors. 34, while deciding as to when can a preliminary issue under Order 14 Rule 2 (2) (b) of CPC be formulated, received the answer in the following words:-

""17. In view of the legal position obtained from the decision in Nusli Neville Wadia's case the following decisions also assume relevance. In the decision in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rattani this Court held that an admission made in the pleadings by a party is admissible in evidence proprio vigore. Equally well settled is the principle of law that an admission made by a party in his pleadings is admissible against him proprio vigore (see the decisions in Ranganayakamma v. K.S. Prakash (Dead) By LRs. and Vimal Chand Ghevarchand Jain v. Ramakant Eknath Jadoo.
18. In the context of the usage of the expression ""admitted facts"" in paragraph 52 of the decision in Nusli Neville Wadia's case and the word 'admission' employed the National Insurance CO. Ltd. case a reference to Sections 17, 18 and 58 of the Indian Evidence Act would not be inappropriate. A conjoint reading of the said provision would reveal that 'statements' by a party to proceedings are admissions and facts admitted need not be proved.
19. We referred to the said provisions and decisions only to stress upon the point that the appellants cannot legally have any dispute or grievance in taking their statements in the plaint capable of determining the starting point of limitation for the purpose of application of Order XIV, Rule 2(2)(b) of the CPC. Though, limitation is a mixed question of law and facts it will shed the said 34 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1322 88/168 CARBP-414-18.odt character and would get confined to one of question of law when the foundational fact(s), determining the starting point of limitation is vividly and specifically made in the plaint averments. In such a circumstance, if the Court concerned is of the opinion that limitation could be framed as a preliminary point and it warrants postponement of settlement of other issues till determination of that issue, it may frame the same as a preliminary issue and may deal with the suit only in accordance with the decision on that issue. It cannot be said that such an approach is impermissible in law and in fact, it is perfectly permissible under Order XIV, Rule 2(2)(b), CPC and legal in such circumstances. In short, in view of the decisions and the provisions, referred above, it is clear that the issue limitation can be framed and determined as a preliminary issue under Order XIV, Rule 2(2)(b), CPC in a case where it can be decided on admitted facts.""
84. The order dated 13/11/2019, has conclusively held that Article 136 apply to a foreign award, since it is stamped as a decree, by referring to the decision of the Apex Court in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. (supra) and M/s. Compania Naviera 'sodnoc vs. Bharat Refinaries Ltd, with respect to limitation being 12 years and the objection raised by E-City that the petition is barred by limitation, by applying Article 137 was rejected.",,,,"All the Respondents collectively have adopted a stand that since the scheme of demerger was sanctioned by the High Court, and it is now not permissible to re-open them after a lapse of considerable time.",,,
,,,,"85. Enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused by a Court, if the Court finds that the enforcement will be contrary to the public policy of India..

The Foreign Awards (Recognition & Enforcement) Act, 1961 which find the term 'Public Policy' in Section 7(1)(b)

(ii) , in absence of workable definition of International Public Policy, has been construed to mean the 'Public Policy' as applied by the Courts in such Foreign Award is sought to be imposed.

In Renusagar (supra), the term 'public policy' applied with reference to the said Act has received following interpretation :-

90/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""46. While observing that ""from the very nature of things, the expressions public policy', 'opposed to public policy' or 'contrary to public policy are incapable of precise definition"" this Court has laid down: (SCC p. 217, para 92) :

""Public policy... connotes some matter which concerns the public good and the public interest. The concept of what is for the public good or in the public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or the public interest has varied from time to time."" (See: Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly.)
47. The need for applying the touchstone of public policy has been thus explained by Sir William Holdsworth:

""In fact, a body of law like the common law, which has grown up gradually with the growth of the nation, necessarily acquires some fixed principles, and if it is to maintain these principles it must be able, on the ground of public policy or some other like ground, to suppress practices which, under ever new disguises, seek to weaken or negative them."" (History of English Law, Vol. III, p. 55)
48. Since the doctrine of public policy is somewhat open-textured and flexible, Judges in England have shown certain degree of reluctance to invoke it in domestic law. There are two conflicting positions which are referred as the 'narrow view' and the 'broad view. According to the narrow view courts cannot create new heads of public policy whereas the broad view countenances judicial law making in this areas. (See: Chitty on Contracts, 26th Edn., Vol. I, a para 1133, pp. 685-686). Similar is the trend of the decision in India. In Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya"" this Court favoured the narrow view when it said:

""... though the heads are not closed and though theoretically it may be permissible to evolve a new head under exceptional circumstances of a changing world, it is admissible in the interest of stability of society not to make any attempt to discover new heads in these days"" (p. 440)
49. In later decisions this Court has, however, leaned towards the broad view. [See: Murlidhar Agarwal v. State of U.P.; Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly at p. 373; Rattan Chand Hira Chand v. Askar Nawaz Jung.]

50. In the field of private international law, courts refuse to apply a rule of foreign law or recognise a foreign judgment or a foreign arbitral award if it is found that the same is contrary to the public policy of the country in which it is sought to be invoked or enforced. The English courts follow the following principles:

""Exceptionally, the English court will not enforce or recognise a right conferred or a duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the facts of the particular case, enforcement or, as the case may be, 91/168 CARBP-414-18.odt recognition, would be contrary to a fundamental policy of English law. The court has, therefore, refused in certain cases to apply foreign law where to do so would in the particular circumstances be contrary to the interests of the United Kingdom or contrary to justice or morality."" (See: Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 8, para 418.)""
In the Act of 1996, Explanation 1 appended, offer the following clarification:-

""Explanation 1. - For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,-
(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or
(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.""
In addition, Explanation 2 offers further clarity, by asserting as under :-

Explanation 2. - For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.",,,,"128. Section 49 casts an obligation upon the Court to satisfy itself that the foreign award in consideration before it is enforceable under Chapter II. This would necessarily mean that the Court would have to satisfy itself that the exceptions to enforcement as set out in Section 48(1) of the Arbitration Act are not attracted, since then the Court is bound to refuse enforcement.",,,
,,,,"In light of Section 5 of FEMA, which empowers the Central Government, in consultation with RBI and in public 94/168 CARBP-414-18.odt interest to impose reasonable restrictions for Current Account Transactions, the power available has been exercised by RBI on various Current Account Transactions, including the transaction under the agreement and what is relied upon is the RBI Circular dated 24/08/2000 and the FEMA (Current Account Transaction Rules), 2000.

Since various submissions have been made with regard to lifting of the Corporate Veil, it would be necessary to deal with these submissions in order to consider whether the Executing Court can at all lift the Corporate Veil by making parties personally liable to satisfy the decree in execution, when the decree/Foreign Award (in the present case) was not passed against them.""",,,

If a Contract is entered to undertake a prohibited act, it would be void ab-initio and would become unenforceable.. If the contract, express or implied, is forbidden by law, definitely no Court shall render assistance to such a Contract. The expression ""public policy"" concerning the agreement relates to the public policy of the country where award is being enforced. Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872 deals with what consideration and objects are lawful and what not. If the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy, in that event, the consideration or object of agreement is said to be unlawful, and any agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful, is void.

The Contract Act does not define the expression 'public policy or opposed to public policy'. The principles governing public policy are capable of expansion or modification.

Enforcement of the foreign award would be refused on the ground that it was contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (1) fundamental policy of Indian Law, (2) interest of India, and (3) justice or morality.

In the context of challenge to domestic awards, Section 34 of the Arbitration Act differentiates between International Commercial Arbitrations held in India and other arbitrations 101/168 CARBP-414-18.odt in India. So far as the 'The Public Policy of India"" ground is concerned, both Sections, 34 and 48 are now placed on the same pedestal, so that in an International Commercial Arbitration conducted in India, the ground of challenge relating to ""Public policy in India"" would be the same as the ground of resisting enforcement of a foreign Award in India.

In Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI ,35 , it is pertinently observed thus :

""41. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32 of Associate Builders13, while no longer being a ground for challenge under ""public policy of India"", would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be characterised as perverse.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"97. Mr.Seksaria has distinguished the said Judgment and observations in Vijay Karia (supra) by submitting that the Reserve Bank of India in reference to the subject Agreement never granted permission and he would submit that Section 47 which was the thrust of the submission, was a case of 'prior approval' and it was in the facts of the case, the following observations came from the Apex Court :-

""88. This reasoning commends itself to us. First and foremost, FEMA -unlike FERA - refers to the nation's policy of managing foreign exchange instead of policing foreign exchange, the policeman being the Reserve Bank of India under FERA. It is important to remember that Section 47 of FERA no longer exists in FEMA, so that transactions that violate FEMA cannot be held to be void. Also, if a particular act violates any provision of FEMA or the Rules framed thereunder, permission of the Reserve Bank of India may be obtained post-facto if such violation can be condoned. Neither the award, nor the agreement being enforced by the award, can, therefore, be held to be of no effect in law. This being the case, a rectifiable breach under FEMA can never be held to be a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law. Even assuming that Rule 21 of the Non-Debt Instrument Rules requires that shares be sold by a resident of India to a non-resident at a sum which shall not be less than the market value of the shares, and a foreign award directs that such shares be sold at a sum less than the market value, the Reserve Bank of India may choose to step in and direct that the aforesaid shares be sold only at the market value and not at the 36 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7810 103/168 CARBP-414-18.odt discounted value, or may choose to condone such breach. Further, even if the Reserve Bank of India were to take action under FEMA, the non-enforcement of a foreign award on the ground of violation of a FEMA Regulation or Rule would not arise as the award does not become void on that count. The fundamental policy of Indian law, as has been held in Renusagar, must amount to a breach of some legal principle or legislation which is so basic to Indian law that it is not susceptible of being compromised. ""Fundamental Policy"" refers to the core values of India's public policy as a nation, which may find expression not only in statutes but also time-honoured, hallowed principles which are followed by the Courts. Judged from this point of view, it is clear that resistance to the enforcement of a foreign award cannot be made on this ground.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"98. The Single Judge of Delhi High Court in Cruz (supra) while dealing with the issue of foreign award violating the provisions of FEMA, by referring to Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. Vs. General Electric Co.37 has held that ""The contravention of any provision of an enactment is not synonymous to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian Law. The expression ""fundamental policy of Indian Law"" refer to the principles and legislative policy on which the Indian Statute and Laws are founded. The expression ""fundamental policy""

connotes the basic and substratal rationale values and principles which form the bedrock of values in our country.",,,,,,,
,,,,"99. In the light of principle objective of New York Convention, being to ensure enforcement of Awards, notwithstanding that the Awards are not rendered in conformity to the national laws, the Delhi High Court held that that ""the objections to enforcement on the ground of public policy must be such that it offend the core values of a member state's national policy which it cannot be expected to compromise"". The Delhi High Court, inter alia, relied on the Judgment of Bombay High Court in POL India Projects Limited vs. Aurelia Reederei Eugen Friederich GmbH Schiffahrtsgesellschaft & Company KG 38, which held that the contention that violation of FEMA was to be treated as equivalent to the earlier violation of FERA was not correct and the conclusion was supported by the following observation :

""104. With the liberalization of our economy, it was felt that FERA must be repealed and new legislation must be enacted. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of FEMA indicate that FEMA was enacted in view of significant developments that had taken place since 1993: there was substantial increase in the foreign exchange reserves, growth in foreign trade, rationalisation of tariffs, current account convertibility, liberalisation of Indian Investments abroad, increased access to external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates and participation of foreign institutional investors in our stock markets. There was a paradigm shift in the statutory policy. The focus had now shifted from prohibiting transactions to a more permissible environment. The fundamental policy of FEMA no longer proscribes or prohibits Indian entities from expanding their business overseas and accepting risks in relation to transactions carried out outside India. And, as the title of FEMA suggests, the policy now is to manage foreign exchange. Under FEMA, all foreign account transactions are permissible subject to any reasonable restriction which the Government may impose in consultation with the RBI. It is now permissible to not only compound irregularities but also seek ex post facto permission. Thus, the question of declining enforcement of a foreign award on the ground of any regulatory compliance or violation of a provision of FEMA would not be warranted.""
The Bombay High Court in case of POL India (supra) had held that even if a permission was required to be taken before execution of Letter of Guarantee , without its compliance, the execution of Letter of Guarantee would not be contrary to fundamental policy of Indian Law and the reasoning adopted was somehow similar when the Court observed thus :

""108. Having held that a simpliciter violation of any particular provision of FEMA cannot be considered synonymous to offending 38(2015) SCC OnLine Bom 1109 105/168 CARBP-414-18.odt the fundamental policy of Indian law, it would also be apposite to mention that enforcement of a foreign award will invariably involve considerations relating to exchange control. The remittance of foreign exchange in favour of a foreign party seeking enforcement of a foreign award may require permissions from the Reserve Bank of India. There may also be a question whether the initial agreement pursuant to which a foreign award has been rendered required any express permission from RBI. However, as indicated earlier, the policy under FEMA is to permit all transactions albeit subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of conserving and managing foreign exchange. India has not accepted full capital account convertibility as yet. Thus, there are transactions for which permission may not be forthcoming. Whereas certain transactions are permitted under FEMA and regulations made thereunder without any further permissions; other transactions may require express permission from the RBI. However, these considerations can be addressed by ensuring that no funds are remitted outside the country in enforcement of a foreign award, without the necessary permissions from the Reserve Bank of India. This would adequately address the issue of public interest and the concerns relating to foreign exchange management, which FEMA seeks to address.
109 .........
110. The contention that enforcement of the Award against Unitech must be refused on the ground that it violates any one or the other provision of FEMA, cannot be accepted; but, any remittance of the money recovered from Unitech in enforcement of the Award would necessarily require compliance of regulatory provisions and/or permissions.""

The Explanation (1) appended to Section 48 itself provides guidance by clarifying that the Award is in conflict with public policy in India if it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian Law or is in conflict with the basic notions of morality or justice.",,,,,,,
,,,,"101. One of the constituents of public policy of India                 is the
expression ""fundamental policy of Indian law"" .               Akin to the
explanation (2) of Section 34(2) of the Act of 1996, Section 48 (2) offers a clarification that whether there is contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian Law, it shall not entail a review on merits of the dispute.

In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra), it was held that violation of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act , 1973, being a statute enacted to safeguard the national economic interest, shall be contrary to the public policy of India and the fundamental policy of Indian law.

A decade later in ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd.39, after examining the grounds on which the Award can be set aside under Section 34 of the Act, the Apex Court held that in addition to the narrower meaning given to the term ""public policy"" in Renusagar (supra) , the Award can be set aside, if it was patently illegal.

Although the Apex Court in ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd. (supra) sought to expand the scope of enquiry to set aside an Award in purely domestic arbitrations by giving a wider interpretation to term 'public policy', it had the effect of being extended to apply equally to Award arising out of International Commercial Arbitration as well as foreign awards, given the language, employed in the statute.",,,,,,,
,,,,"The Law Commission further recommended restriction of the scope of 'public policy' to bring the definition in line with the one propounded in Renusagar (supra) .

Before the recommendations could be implemented, the term 'fundamental policy of Indian law' was construed widely by the Apex Court in ONGC Vs. Western GECO International Ltd.40, to include Wednesbury principle of reasonableness when the Apex Court without exhaustively enumerating the purport of the expression 'fundamental policy of Indian law' referred to the three drastic principles which would be understood to be a part and parcel of fundamental policy of Indian law, which included, adopting a judicial approach, following principles of natural justice and absence of perversity or irregularity tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury principles of reasonableness.

The Apex Court, thus incorporated the Wednesbury principle of reasonableness as a part of fundamental policy of Indian Law .",,,,,,,
,,,,"103. In Associate Builders Vs. DDA41 the Apex Court further fortified this concept of fundamental policy of Indian Law to include - violation of FERA and disregard to the orders of the superior Courts and the three juristic principles as expounded in Western GECO, the principles not being exhaustive, but capable of further expansion. Since the Law commission was of the view that the clarification was needed to ensure that the term 'fundamental policy of Indian law"" is narrowly construed and if such clarification is not provided all 40 (2014) 9 SCC 263 41 (2015) 3 SCC 49 108/168 CARBP-414-18.odt amendments suggested by it, in relation to the term ""public policy"" and ""fundamental policy of Indian Law"" will be rendered negatory which would permit review of an Arbitral Award on merits, and would be opening for challenges on this ground, the suggestion made by the Law Commission were adopted and the Act was amended with effect from 23/10/2015.

In Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. (supra) the Apex Court embarked on the journey of tracing amendments in the backdrop of the statement of object of the 2015 Amendment and it was held that that the expression 'fundamental policy of Indian Law', would be relegated to Renusagar (supra) understanding i.e. violation of provisions of FERA and disregard to the Judgments of of superior of Court.",,,,,,,

This decision of Delhi High Court received approval from the Apex Court in Vijay Karia (supra) by adding that, ""fundamental policy refers to the core values of India's public policy as a Nation, which may find expression not only in statute, but also time honored, hallowed principles, which are followed by the Courts"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"106. In Vijay Karia (supra), the Apex Court reaffirmed the principle that for violation of fundamental policy of Indian Law, there shall be a breach of legal principle of legislation that is so basic to Indian Law that the same cannot be compromised and mere violation of any enactment shall not be a breach of fundamental policy of Indian Law and while expounding this proposition, the Apex Court created a narrow opening to include not only legislation/ enactments that can be said to be integral part of the policy of India, but also time honored hallowed principles which are consistently followed by the Courts in India.

The time honored hallowed principles forming core value of national policy, may cover an Award which is passed in disregard to the orders passed by the superior Court or passing an Award on the basis of the void contract or upholding the transaction rendered void by a Statute, as these may be some of the illustrations of the legal principles, which are incapable of being compromised, and in any case, the list may not be exhaustive.",,,,,,,

In this background, the export without permission was in violation of the law and it was conclusively held that enforcement of such award would be violative of the public policy of India.",,,,,,,
,,,,"NAFED, by relying upon clause 14 of the agreement, adopted a stand that on happening of the contingency agreed 111/168 CARBP-414-18.odt to by the parties, the contract was rendered unenforceable under Section 32 of the Contract Act and as such, it could not be held liable to pay damages under foreign award.",,,,,,,
,,,,"While deriving its conclusion, reliance was placed upon Section 32 of the Contract Act and I must gainfully reproduce the relevant observations.

""44. In the present case, parties have agreed, and in Clause 14 of the Agreement, it was contemplated that during the contract if there is any prohibition of the export or any other executive or legislative Act by or on behalf the Government of the Country of origin, the unfulfilled part of the contract shall be cancelled. Because of the refusal by the Government, it was not permissible to NAFED to make a supply to the Alimenta S.A. Hence, the unfulfilled part was required to be cancelled. Thus, NAFED was justified in not making the supply as it would have violated the Export Control Order, and it was not permissible to carry forward the quantity of the previous year to the next year because of the Export Control Order without permission of the Government.
45. It is apparent that the contract came to an end in terms of Clause 14 of the Agreement. The contract became void in view of the provisions contained in Section 32 of the Indian Contract Act, 1881 (for short, ""the Contract Act""). The stipulation in Clause 14 releases both parties from the performance of the contract.

48. Section 32 of the Contract Act applies in case the agreement itself provides for contingencies upon happening of which contract cannot be carried out and provide the consequences.

In case an act becomes impossible at a future date, and that exigency is not provided in the agreement on the happening of which exigency, impossible or unlawful, the promisor had no control 112/168 CARBP-414-18.odt which he could not have prevented, the contract becomes void as provided in Section 56.......
49. In the present case, because of the clear stipulation in Clause 14 of the Agreement, it is apparent that the parties have agreed for a contingent contract. They knew very well that the Government's executive, or legislative actions might come in the way as provided in Clause 14 of the Agreement. Thus, in this case, Section 32 of the Contract Act is attracted and not the provisions of section 56. It was an agreement to do an act impossible in itself without permission, and that is declared to be void by Section 32. The contract was capable of being performed in case the Government gave the requisite authorisation. It is not an event that was not in contemplation at the time of entering into the agreement. Government permission was necessary. Section 56 is not attracted as the promisor and promisee both knew the reason in advance as in agreement such a contingency was provided itself in case of Government's executive order comes in the way, for cancellation of the contract. Thus, the contract became void on the happening of the contingency, as provided in Section 32 of the Contract Act.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"In conclusion, the Apex Court held thus :-

""58. It would have been unlawful for NAFED to affect the supply in view of the Government's refusal to accord the permission, and both the parties knew it very well and agreed that the contract would be cancelled in such an exigency for no-supply in quantity. Thus, they were bound by the agreement. The award pre- supposes supply could have been made after the Government's refusal. If supply had been made, it would have been unlawful. Thus, the parties agreed for its cancellation as such an award is against the basic law and public policy as applied in India.
59. It is also apparent that the Government rightly objected to the supply being made at the rate of the previous season in the next season, particularly when the prices escalated thrice. The addendum was entered into subsequently, unfairly, and the parties fully understood that the Government would not permit export at the rate on which supply was proposed, and NAFED was acting only as a canalising agent of the Government of India. Thus, for such an unfair contract, permission was rightly declined by the Government. In the previous year, the commodity could not be supplied due to force majeure. In no event, supply could have been made in December 1980 and January 1981 sans permission from the Government of India.""
108. Answering the question as to whether award can be contrary to the public policy, with reference to Section 23 of the Contract Act, which prescribed as to what consideration 113/168 CARBP-414-18.odt and objects are lawful and what are not, it was noted that the consideration or object of an agreement is unlawful, if the Court regard it as immoral or against the public policy and it would be void. On an exact exhaustive reproduction of the observations in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra), Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. (supra) as well as Western GECO (supra), in the wake of clause 14 of the agreement and as per the law applicable in India, it was concluded that no export could have taken place without the permission of the Government and the appellant-NAFED was unable to supply in absence of these permissions. This was held to be a matter pertaining to fundamental policy of India and the conclusion of the Apex Court was worded explicitly as below :-

""69. It is apparent from abovementioned decisions as to enforceability of foreign awards, Clause 14 of FOSFA Agreement and as per the law applicable in India, no export could have taken place without the permission of the Government, and NAFED was unable to supply, as it did not have any permission in the season 1980-1981 to effect the supply, it required the permission of the Government. The matter is such which pertains to the fundamental policy of India and parties were aware of it, and contracted that in such an exigency as provided in clause 14, the Agreement shall be cancelled for the supply which could not be made. It became void under Section 32 of the Contract Act on happening of contingency. Thus, it was not open because of the clear terms of the Arbitration Agreement to saddle the liability upon NAFED to pay damages as the contract became void. There was no permission to export commodity of the previous year in the next season, and then the Government declined permission to NAFED to supply. Thus, it would be against the fundamental public policy of India to enforce such an award, any supply made then would contravene the public policy of India relating to export for which permission of the Government of India was necessary.
70. In our considered opinion, the award could not be said to be enforceable, given the provisions contained in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. As per the test laid down in Renusagar, its enforcement would be against the fundamental policy of Indian Law and the basic concept of justice. Thus, we hold that award is unenforceable, and the High Court erred in law in holding otherwise in a perfunctory manner.""

Yet another exposition of law on this subject by the Apex Court is in the case of Asha John Divianathan (supra), which has reiterated that a contract is void, if it is prohibited by a statute imposing penalty, even without expressed declaration that the contract is void and this was in reference to Section 31 of the FERA, to be read with other provisions in the Act, contemplating obtaining of previous permission of RBI, which was held to operate in the nature of prohibition. Holding that a transfer/transaction in contravention of requirement of previous permission of RBI under Section 31 of FERA is void, it is held that no ex post facto permission can be granted by RBI under Section 31.

Asha John Divianathan (supra) relied upon Vijay Karia (supra), while it concluded that the requirement of seeking general or special permission of RBI in respect of transaction covered by Section 31 of the FERA is mandatory and in a transaction of sale or gift of the property situated in India by a foreigner in contravention thereof would be unenforceable in law.",,,,,,,
,,,,"In the appeal before the Apex Court, the appellant-Asha John urged that the gift deeds are null and void and not binding upon her, as they are unenforceable in light of mandate of Section 31 of the Act of 1973. In support of the submission, reliance was placed upon the decision in the case of Renusagar Power CO. Ltd. (supra ) and Vijay Karia (supra).",,,,,,,
,,,,"Focusing upon the avowed object of Section 31, being to minimise the drainage of foreign exchange by way of repatriation of income from immovable property and sale proceeds in case of disposal of property by a person, who is not a citizen of India, its purpose was highlighted being to put restrictions on acquisition, holding and disposal of immovable property in India by foreigners/non-citizens.

In paragraphs 19 and 20, the scope of this Section was clearly summarized in the following words :-

""19. On a bare reading of Section 31(1), it is crystal clear that a person, who is not a citizen of India, is not competent to dispose of by sale or gift, as in this case, any immovable property situated in India without previous general or special permission of RBI. The only exception provided in the proviso is that of acquisition or transfer of immovable property by way of lease for a period not exceeding five years. This provision applies to foreign citizens and foreign and FERA companies only. A non-resident Indian Citizen is not covered thereunder......
20. In other words, a person, who is not a citizen of India, holding immovable property situated in India was obliged to make disclosure and declaration in that behalf of RBI; and in any case, if he/she intended to dispose of such property by sale, mortgage, lease, gift, settlement or otherwise, was expected to obtain previous general or special permission from RBI. Only the, transfer so intended could be given effect to. It is true that the consequences of failure to seek such previous permission have not been explicitly specified in the same provision or elsewhere in the Act, but then the purport of Section 31 must be understood in the context of intent with which it has been enacted, the general policy not to allow foreign investment in landed property/buildings constructed by foreigners or to allow them to enter into real estate business to eschew capital repatriation, including the purport of other provisions of the Act, such as Sections 47, 50 and 63.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"111. The soul of the decision lies in its observation in paragraph 26, which read as under :-
""26. It is well established that a contract is void if prohibited by a statute under a penalty, even without express declaration that the contract is void, because such a penalty implies a prohibition. Further, it is settled that prohibition and negative words can rarely be directory. In the present dispensation provided under Section 31 of the 1973 Act read with Sections 47, 50 and 63 of the same Act, although it may be a case of seeking previous permission it is in the nature of prohibition as observed by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Mannalal Khetan v. Kedar Nath Khetan. In every case where a statute imposes a penalty for doing an act, though, the act not prohibited, yet the thing is unlawful because it is not intended that a statute would impose a penalty for a lawful act. When penalty is imposed by statute for the purpose of preventing something from being done on some ground of public policy, the thing prohibited, if done, will be treated as void, even though the penalty if imposed is not enforceable....""",,,,,,,
,,,,"112. From the analysis of Section 31 of the Act and upon conjoint reading of Sections 47, 50 and 63 on facts, it was concluded thus :-

""32. ...we must hold that the requirement of taking ""previous""
permission of RBI before executing the sale deed or gift deed is the quintessence; and failure to do so must render the transfer unenforceable in law. The dispensation under Section 31 mandates ""previous"" or ""prior"" permission of RBI before the transfer takes effect. For, RBI is competent to refuse to grant permission in a given case. The sale or gift could be given effect and taken forward only after such permission is accorded by RBI. There is no possibility of ex post facto permission being granted by RBI u nder Section 31 of the 1973 Act, unlike in the case of Section 29 as noted in LIC. Before grant of such permission, if the sale deed or gift deed is challenged by a person affected by the same directly or indirectly and the court declares it to be invalid, despite the document being registered, no clear title would pass on to the recipient or beneficiary under such deed. The clear title would pass on and the deed can be given effect to only if permission is accorded by RBI under Section 31 of the 1973 Act to such transaction.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"113. Taking note of cleavage of opinion that revolve around the effect of Section 13 of FERA and by recording a specific observation that merely because no provision in the Act makes 120/168 CARBP-414-18.odt the transaction void or say that no title in the property passes to the purchaser in case there is contravention of the provision of Section 31 is of no avail, as that does not validate the transaction referred to in Section 31, which is not backed by ""previous"" permission of RBI.

By referring to the distinct opinions expressed by different High Courts, it is held that the decisions, eventually seal the position of law that when the enforcement of the contract is against any provision of law, it will amount to enforcement of an illegal contract, though the contract per say may not be illegal, but its enforcement requires compliance of statutory conditions and its failure would, therefore, amount to statutory violation and this view was found to be acceptable. Holding that the requirement of seeking previous, general or special permission, of RBI is mandatory, the contrary decisions of the High Court were held to have missed the legislative intent and the spirit of enacting Section 31 and until such permission is accorded in law, the transfer cannot be given effect to and for contravening that requirement, the person may be visited with penalty and consequences provided in 1973 Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"115. I must also take note of the defence adopted by E-City before the ICC, when it filed its submission of defence, when it averred that the terms of agreement contemplated that it was contingent upon E-City receiving RBI's approval.

Coming to the awards, the liability award dated 09/02/2006 passed in favour of IMAX, the submission about RBI' approval is taken note of and even the correspondence made on behalf of the E-City and the authorised dealer (SBI) to the RBI is also produced, but the Tribunal has observed that there was no hint or suggestion in these letters that this was other than the done deed and a further observation in the declaratory award, must be taken note of :-

""The Tribunal finds that the parties did intend to create legal relationship and be bound by 28th September, 2000 agreement. That is supported by the contemporaneous record not least E-City's letter to RBI and the SBI.""
In the statement of defence in the post liability phase also, E- City reiterated that it was obliged under investment to obtain approval from RBI as per Clause 14 of the agreement, but no such transfer came despite request.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"118. It being a well settled principle, right from the decision of the Apex Court in Renusagar (supra) that violation of Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding the orders of superior courts in India, would be regarded as being contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law, since the mandatory condition of obtaining approval of RBI is not satisfied in the present case, which was necessary and the preceding condition for executing an Agreement for Lease, which definitely is not curable in nature, and if any remittances were made without its approval, it would have impacted the Indian economy and affected the interest of the public at large and, 124/168 CARBP-414-18.odt therefore, it amounts to breach of fundamental policy of Indian Law as violations of FEMA is not curable and as distinguished, the observations of the Apex Court in the case of Asha John has clarified the position.",,,,,,,
,,,,"119. Another aspect which Mr. Seksaria representing E-City, being a matter of public policy, in form of 'fair hearing' which is placed into service, also deserve an analysis.",,,,,,,
,,,,"121. The principle set out by Latham LJ as a general rule was reproduced which read thus :
127/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""The general rule in adversarial proceedings, as between the parties, is that one party should not be entitled to impugn the evidence of another party's witness if he has not asked appropriate questions enabling the witness to deal with the criticisms that are being made.""
It was further elaborated by stating that the procedural fairness not only to the parties but to the witness, requires that if their evidence were to be disbelieved, then they must be given a fair opportunity to deal with the allegation.

On taking review of the case law on this point, the rules of natural justice were clearly culled out with reference to Browne Vs. Dunn42 to the following effect :

""70. In conclusion, the status and application of the rule in Browne v Dunn and the other cases which I have discussed can be summarised in the following propositions:
(i) The general rule in civil cases, as stated in Phipson, 20th ed, para 12-12, is that a party is required to challenge by cross-",,,,,,,
,,,,"123. Justice PB Mukharji in AEG Carapiet (supra), by relying upon Browne (supra), has concluded thus in Para 9 :-

""9. The law is clear on the subject. Wherever the opponent has declined to avail /himself of the opportunity to put his essential and material case in cross-examination, it must follow that he believed that the testimony given could not be disputed at all. It is wrong to think that this is merely a technical rule of evidence. It is a rule of essential justice. It serves to prevent surprise at trial and miscarriage of justice, because it gives notice to the other side of the actual case that is going to be made when the turn of the party on whose behalf the cross- examination is being made comes to give and lead evidence by producing witnesses. It has been stated on high authority of the House of Lords that this much a counsel is bound to do when cross- examining that he must put to each of his opponent's witnesses in turn, so much of his own case as concerns that particular witness or in which that witness had any share. If he asks no question with regard to this, then he must be taken to accept the plaintiff's account in its entirety. Such failure leads to miscarriage of justice, first by springing surprise upon the party when he has finished the evidence of his witnesses and when he has no further chance to meet the new case made which was never put and secondly, because such subsequent testimony has no chance of being tested and corroborated.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"In Para 16 of the Partial Final Award on jurisdiction and quantum the Tribunal took note of the following :-

""16. In the event, Mr. Chudasama was not called to give oral testimony in London, Mr.Cooperman indicating that he did not require to cross-examine him and Mr.Coomaraswamy SC saying that therefore he would not call him. However, in accordance with normal practice, Mr. Chudasama's statement was admitted as his evidence and became part of the record of the arbitration.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"125. Further in the very same Award, when the Respondent raised a issue on the role of RBI, by stating that the lack of RBI approval made the conclusion of any Agreement even less feasible and the RBI never came up with any request or suggestion to make this or another structure more feasible, Tribunal observed thus :

""52. But is it open to the Respondent to take this point that the proper exercise of the powers RBI would have precluded the implementation of the contracts as permission would not have been forthcoming? It was to this issue that the evidence of Mr Chudasama was directed. Here again, the Respondent falls foul of the ruling of this Tribunal at the liability stage.
53. At paragraph 120 the Tribunal said this:
130/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""......Neither, for that matter, does Clause 14 when referring to the Reserve Bank of India, say that permission of the Bank is a condition precedent to the entry into force of the agreement. On the contrary all that Clause 14 does is refer to the obligation of the parties to negotiate a change in the structure should the Reserve Bank of India not approve it, in itself a recognition that the structure established by the Agreement was binding. It was, after all, that Agreement which would be submitted to the Reserve Bank of India. The renegotiation of the structure must take place within the clearly defined parameters of Clause 14 itself. In the Tribunal's view it would be open to arbitrators, were there to be a dispute as to significant adverse effect, to resolve that by an award.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"What the Tribunal has failed to consider is, in this particular case where the LOI refer to entering into separate Agreement for Lease never received approval from Reserve Bank of India, which IMAX and other Indian Parties had entered in to, had received its approval.

Unfortunately, the Arbitral Tribunal has rendered a finding the evidence of Chudasama going uncontrovered and this is clearly in the teeth of Browne (supra).",,,,,,,
,,,,"It is noted that the scheme of de-merger has been sanctioned by the High Court and is already implemented. It is also evident that the Petitioner was well aware of the demerger scheme when it approached the Court in Ontario, Canada, for recognition of the foreign Award, but instead of raising a challenge to the demerger scheme, the Petitioner preferred to prosecute the proceedings in Canada and subsequently in New York and on failing in its attempts of recognizing and executing foreign award in New York, the Petitioner has approached this Court raising objection to the demerger scheme which was sanctioned by the competent Court in India.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"128. I have perused the orders passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, in the Company Petitions, where sanction was sought from the Court to the scheme of demerger under Section 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.

The Petitions filed by E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt. Ltd. placed before the Court alongwith the necessary statutory 132/168 CARBP-414-18.odt compliance and Affidavit filed by the Regional Director to that effect, was duly accepted by the court by recording an undertaking that the necessary compliances shall be carried out, and by further recording that there is no objection in sanctioning the scheme of demerger, the Petitions were made absolute, by directing the Company Petitioner to take appropriate steps by passing a special resolution as contemplated under Section 100 of the Companies Act and by declaring that the scheme of de-merger shall come into effect only upon such resolution being passed.

The first order dated 20/6/2007 deals with the first de- merger involving E-City Real Estate Pvt. Ltd., whereas, the second dealt with the E-City Project Construction Pvt. Ltd. In the Affidavit filed by Respondent No.1 to the Petition, the justification for the demerger is offered indicating the process that was followed in the following manner :

""I say that since the company had received an attractive investment proposal from a strategic financial investor who was willing to invest in company's properties namely Lucknow, Kanpur and Coimbatore which were compliant with the FDI norms. Therefore, it was decided to demerge the FDI compliant properties into a new company. I say that on August 31, 2006, Board of Directors of Respondent No. 2 approved the scheme of demerger. I say that on October 31, 2006, Board of Directors of Respondent No. 3 NOTARY approved the scheme of demerger.
With respect to paragraph 42, I say that on November 15, 2006 Respondent No. 1 filed a demerger petition before this Hon'ble Court. The ""effective date"" is only a nominal date on which the sanctions, approval or orders specified in Clause 20 of the Scheme are to be obtained. I say that the purpose of the demerger process was to hive off the real estate division of Respondent No. 1 to Respondent No. 2 in order to allow certain assets of Respondent No. 1 to be permitted to receive FDI, as permissible under the relevant Act of Government of India.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"The order permitting the demerger has ensured the statutory compliance as stipulated under Section 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 viz. i)the latest financial position of the Company and ii) latest Auditors Report on the accounts of the Company. The form and contents of the balance-sheet and profit and loss are stipulated in Section 211 of the Companies Act read with Schedule VI and disclosures as required were made in the Note to Accounts which included the contingent liabilities and commitments. The mandatory disclosures required, form part of the Petition and the High Court ensured the compliance of the Rules while sanctioning the scheme of arrangement/demerger as prescribed under Rule 67-87 including Form No.'40' of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959.",,,,,,,
,,,,"146. The relevant excerpts of the Annual Report filed on behalf of the Petitioner for the fiscal year ending on 31/12/2006 had clearly recorded in relation to the same as below :-

""Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
......In January 2004, the Company and IMAX Theatre Services Ltd..... on February 1, 2006, the ICC issued an Award on liability finding unanimously in companies favour on all claims....... The ICC Panel has not yet rendered its decision with respect to damages and no amount has yet been recorded for these damages.""",,,,,,,
,,,,130. The liability award dated 9/6/2006 in favour of IMAX has inter alia declared; (i) the Master Agreement dated 28/9/2000 give rise to legal binding obligation and (ii) E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt Ltd had breached its obligations under the Master Agreement.,,,,,,,
,,,,"132. The declaration sought in the Arbitration Petition in favour of the petitioner to the effect that the three awards passed by the Arbitral Tribunal are enforceable under Part II of the Act of 1996, and the further direction to enforce and execute them as decree in favour of the petitioner and against all the respondents. Similarly, the relief of deposit of the decretal amounts is also sought against the Respondent Nos.1 to 4, but since Mr.Chinoy has offered a clarity that the petitioner seek recognition only against E-City Entertainment, but since it, with an intention to defeat the awards, it has divested its assets to Respondent Nos.2 and 3, they are impleaded in the proceedings.

139/168 CARBP-414-18.odt It is, therefore, clear from the submission of Mr.Chinoy that the Petitioner do not seek recognition or enforcement against Respondent Nos.2 and 3, and dealing with the preliminary objection raised on behalf of Mr.Seervai, representing Respondent Nos.2 and 3, that these entities have no role to play in the whole episode, Mr.Chinoy has invoked the law laid down by this Court in Bhatia Industries (supra) which has categorically ruled on the doctrine of Piercing Corporate Veil in the execution proceedings which is not restricted only to the cases of holding subsidiary companies or case of tax evasion, but is equally applicable in execution proceedings.",,,,,,,
,,,,"135. To appreciate whether this Court would be justified in piercing the corporate veil as sought by the Petitioner, I must focus on the scheme of Part II of the Act of 1996, which looked at holistically, demonstrates that Foreign Awards are only held to be binding between the parties to the arbitration proceedings.",,,,,,,
,,,,"136. Section 48 of the Act of 1996 which set out the conditions for enforcement of foreign awards, also specifically refer to the 'party against whom it is invoked', and even sub- clause (b) of sub-section (1) thereof also refer to the same terminology.

A reading of the Chapter I in Part II of the Act of 1996, lead to a position that Section 44, which has used the expression ""persons"", which necessarily stipulate that the 142/168 CARBP-414-18.odt legal relationship between the parties need not be a contractual one. Further, the power to be exercised under section 45, to refer the parties to arbitration, permit its exercise at the request of one of the parties. Moreso, Section 45 which is the power of judicial authority to refer the parties to arbitration, has used the phrase "".... parties or any person claiming through or under him, ......""

128. Section 49 casts an obligation upon the Court to satisfy itself that the foreign award in consideration before it is enforceable under Chapter II. This would necessarily mean that the Court would have to satisfy itself that the exceptions to enforcement as set out in Section 48(1) of the Arbitration Act are not attracted, since then the Court is bound to refuse enforcement.

It is important to highlight that the scheme of the Arbitration Act as contained in Part II has a categoric distinction in language with regard to provisions that come into play at the pre-arbitration stage when compared to the provisions that are attracted only at the post-award stage.

Whilst Section 44 contemplates arbitration proceedings between persons having a legal relationship that may or may not be contractual, Section 45 contemplates invocation of arbitration not only by a party to the agreement also by parties that claim through or under a party to the agreement.

In contrast, the post-award provisions such as Sections 46 and 48 read with Section 49 specifically deploy restrictive language that reflects the fact that an award, once made, is only binding on those persons who were parties to the arbitration proceedings.

143/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Another clear indicator of the legislative intent to recognize foreign awards as binding only between the parties between whom it was made comes to light when comparing the language of Section 46 (under Part II) and Section 35 (under Part I) of the Arbitration Act. Whilst the finality ascribed to foreign awards under Section 46 is only between the parties to the arbitration proceedings, the finality ascribed to awards under Part I is significantly wider where awards under Part I are held to be final and binding on not only the parties to the arbitration proceedings but also as between the persons claiming under them.",,,,,,,
,,,,"137. Mr.Seervai as well as Mr.Jagtiani have heavily relied upon the decision in case of Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra) where the detail analysis of the relevant provisions of Part II of the Act is undertaken by the Apex Court, in the backdrop of the issue of enforceability of foreign award against the parties who though non signatories to the to the Arbitration Agreement were parties to the Arbitration Proceedings.

The decision has brought about the interplay between distinct provisions in Part II of the Act of 1996 with extreme precision and lucidity and I must reproduce the thrust of the said decision :-

""43. Given the parameters, let us examine arguments of the appellants insofar as Section 48(1)(a) is concerned. If read literally, Section 48(1)(a) speaks only of parties to the agreement being under some incapacity, or the agreement being invalid under the law to which parties have subjected it. There can be no doubt that a non-party to the agreement, alleging that it cannot be bound by an award made under such agreement, is outside the literal construction of Section 48(1)(a). Also, it must not be forgotten that whereas Section 44 speaks of an arbitral award on differences 144/168 CARBP-414-18.odt between ""persons"" Section 48(1)(a) refers only to the ""parties"" to the agreement referred to in Section 44(a). Thus, to include non- parties to the agreement by introducing the word ""person"" would run contrary to the express language of Section 48(1)(a), when read with Section 44. Also, it must not be forgotten that these grounds cannot be expansively interpreted as has been held above. The grounds are in themselves specific, and only speak of incapacity of parties and the agreement being invalid under the law to which the parties have subjected it. To attempt to bring non- parties within this ground is to try and fit a square peg in a round hole.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"138. Reliance is placed by Mr.Chinoy upon the decision of learned Single Judge in Mitsui OSK Lines Limited (Japan) (supra), which is distinguished by Mr.Seksaria, where an execution application seeking execution of a foreign award was sought to be amended in order to implead third parties to the execution proceedings despite them not being parties to the arbitration proceedings. The basis to implead third-parties in this case was that monies had purportedly been siphoned off from award-debtor's account in favor of these third parties who were said to be related entities. In addition, reliance was also placed on the state of affairs between the third-parties and the award-debtor as reflected from the books of account which, according to the award-creditor, demonstrated that the companies' affairs were inextricably linked to one another and they operated in similar businesses. However, the Court was pleased to dismiss the chamber summons after observing as under:-

""69. The Chamber Summons appears on the face of it to be an attempt on the part of the Award Holder to trace monies in the hands of the Additional Respondents, particularly, since the Additional Respondents were not parties to the arbitration proceedings and/or the Foreign Award. Such personal liability sought to be imposed upon the Additional Respondents can only be determined in a substantial suit being filed by the Award Holder against the Additional Respondents. By allowing the Award Holder 145/168 CARBP-414-18.odt to execute the Foreign Award against the Additional Respondents by making them personally liable, the Executing Court would indeed be proceeding behind and/or beyond the decree.
71. Considering that this is a Foreign Award of which the execution has been sought by the Award Holder, it would be necessary to consider the relevant provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 viz. Section 48 thereof. Section 48 of the said Act reads thus :-
.......
72. It is clear from this provision that the party against whom the Foreign Award is to be enforced, is required to be given an opportunity as to why the Foreign Award should not be enforced against it. The provision also contemplates a case where the enforcement of the Foreign Award may be refused by the Court and which includes where the subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of India or the enforcement of the Award is contrary to the public policy of India.
The Additional Respondents not being parties to the foreign arbitration proceedings and/or the Foreign Award, the Chamber Summons appears to evade this provision. The Additional Respondents have not been given an opportunity to show cause as to why the Foreign Award should not be enforced against them, as they were not parties as envisaged under Section 48 of the said Act. The Foreign Award was enforceable only against the Judgment Debtor who was the party to the arbitration agreement and against whom the Foreign Award was passed. The Foreign Award cannot be enforced against the Additional Respondents who are neither parties to the arbitration agreement nor to the Award.

73. Various allegations of fraud have been averred in the Chamber Summons which are nothing but bare assertions, allegations, surmises and conjectures and hence, it would not be necessary for this Court to go into the same, without the same being established. These allegations have been made in support of the Applicant's contention that the Corporate Veil is required to be lifted to execute the Foreign Award against the Additional Respondents albeit they are not parties to the Foreign Award and/or the Foreign Award not having been passed against them. Since various submissions have been made with regard to lifting of the Corporate Veil, it would be necessary to deal with these submissions in order to consider whether the Executing Court can at all lift the Corporate Veil by making parties personally liable to satisfy the decree in execution, when the decree/Foreign Award (in the present case) was not passed against them.""
",,,,,,,
,,,,"139. The decision in Mitsui (supra) has distinguished the earlier decision of this Court in Bhatia Industries in the following words :-

146/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""74. The Award Holder has not been able to produce a Single judgment where, as in the present case, the Additional Respondents are to be made personally liable to satisfy the decree passed against the Respondent/Judgment Debtor. In fact, the judgment relied upon by the Award Holder viz. Bhatia Industries And Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) is entirely distinguishable on facts as in that case, the attachment was alleged to be made in respect of coal which belonged to BIIL and not the Judgment Debtor (BIL). It was when the said BIIL sought to vacate the attachment, the Division Bench of this Court concluded that both BIL and BIIL are in fact, one and the same and therefore, the attachment was in effect of the properties of BIL. the Judgment Debtor. In fact, it appears from the decision of the Single Judge in case of Bhatia Industries And Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) that, the claim made by the BIIL that the coal belonging to it, could not be attached as BIIL is not the Judgment Debtor was held to be false and a finding was arrived at that the coal in fact belonging to BIL who was the Judgment Debtor. In the present case the Award Holder is not going against the Associate Companies who are the Additional Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in respect of particular assets claiming that they belong to the Judgment Debtor, but is in fact, making the Additional Respondents personally liable in respect of the Foreign Award passed against the Judgment Debtor. Hence, the judgment in Bhatia Industries And Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) will have no application in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In any event, the Supreme Court in case of Bhatia Industries And Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) has kept the question of law open. Considering that the ratio decidendi arrived at in the case of Bhatia Industries And Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) does not apply to the present case, the precedent relied upon by the Award Holder cannot apply in the facts and circumstances of the present case.""
",,,,,,,
,,,,"140. The ruling in Bhatia Industries (supra) as regards the permissibility of piercing the corporate veil which has relied upon the decision of Delhi High Court in Formosa Plastic Corporation Ltd. vs. Ashok Chauhan43, in my considered opinion would not govern the present case as the doctrine of ""alter ego"" and the piercing of corporate veil has been exhaustively deliberated upon by the Apex Court in case of Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra).

Bhatia Industries (supra) was a case dealing with execution of foreign award and the issue relating to piercing of 43 1999(1) AD (Delhi) 392 147/168 CARBP-414-18.odt the corporate veil arose at the stage of issuance of precepts under Section 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Court was not called upon to consider the enforceability of the Award and, therefore, the entire scheme of Part II including Section 48 which prescribe that foreign awards can only be enforced against parties to the arbitration, was not considered by the learned Single Judge in Bhatia Industries (supra).

The decision in Bhatia Industries (supra) was subjected to challenge by way of SLP (c) No. 31066/2016 and by order dated 07.11.2016 the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP by offering a clarification that the question of law set out therein was kept open.",,,,,,,
,,,,"141. In Mitsui (supra) Justice Chagla had an opportunity to deal with the principle of piercing the corporate veil at the stage of execution, in order to proceed against third parties and he distinguished the position in Bhatia Industries ( supra) with the following observations :

""82. It is thus clear that the context of that decision was in respect of the statute which itself required the Corporate Veil to be lifted. The principles have been set out in above paragraph for lifting of the Corporate Veil, which would arise where statute lifts the Corporate Veil or where protection of public interest is of paramount importance or where company has been formed to evade obligations imposed by the law, then the Court will disregard the Corporate Veil. The Judgment Creditor in the present case has not satisfied any of these principles and accordingly, the lifting of the Corporate Veil is not at all justified in the facts and circumstances of the present case. This finding is without prejudice to the earlier finding that in the present case the lifting of the Corporate Veil cannot at all arise as the Additional Respondents are neither the parties to the Foreign Arbitration Agreement nor parties to the Foreign Award and as such cannot be proceeded against in execution of the Foreign Award. Further, the Additional Respondents are neither legal representatives nor representatives of the Judgment Debtor within the meaning of the provisions of the CPC which is a complete code in itself.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"142. With reference              to the law that has evolved from the
Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra) as well as decision of the learned Single Judge in Mitsui (supra), it can be gainfully inferred that on plain reading of Section 44 to 48 of the Act of 1996, persons other than parties to the commercial relationship cannot be arraigned in enforcement/execution proceedings and it is claimed that IMAX did not implead the Respondents in the arbitral proceedings at the relevant time, as a consequence they were never afforded an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and now to foist the liability under the Arbitral Awards on them,at the stage of execution/enforcement, would amount to gross failure of natural justice and is also a facet to be construed as in violation of fundamental policy of the Indian Law.
It is only a party to the Award which can raise an objection to it under Section 48(1) and in Gemini Bay Transcription Private Limited (supra) the Supreme Court has clearly interpreted that Section 48(1)(a) speaks only of parties to the Agreement deemed under some capacity, or the Agreement being invalid under the law to which the Parties have subjected it and definitely the non-party to the Agreement is outside its purview. The Apex Court had also distinguished the English case in Dallah Real Estate & Tourism Holding Co. vs. Ministry of Religious Affairs44, by recording a specific finding that :-
"" Given the conclusion on Section 48 (1)(a) when read with Section 44 of the Arbitration Act, we cannot follow what is stated to be ""International practice"" and trying to fit a non-signatory's objection to a foreign award being binding upon it under Section 48(1)(a). We therefore distinguish Dallah case (Dallah Real Estate & Tourism 44(2011) 1 AC 763 149/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Holding Co. v. Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Govt. of Pakistan, (201) 1 AC 763: (2010) 3 WLR 1472) on facts as well as on law - a non-signatory's oibjection cannot possibly fit into Section 48(1) (a) as has been held by us hereinabove. Without delving deep into this problem, it may perhaps be open in an appropriate case for a non-
signatory to bring its case within Section 48(2) read with Explanation 1 (iii) as explained in Sangyong.""",,,,,,,

The learned senior counsel Mr.Jagtiani has invoked the fundamental principle of company law as extended in Salomon (supra), about the company being an independent legal entity distinct from its shareholders and this fundamental principle of company law was found its entry in Indian jurisprudence and was noticed in Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. & Ors. (supra), in the following words :-

""24. The true legal position in regard to the character of a corporation or a company which owes its incorporation to a statutory authority, is not in doubt or dispute. The corporation in law is equal to a natural person and has a legal entity of its own. The entity of the corporation is entirely separate from that of its shareholders; it bears its own name and has a seal of its own; its assets are separate and distinct from those of its members; it can sue and be sued exclusively for its own purpose; its creditors cannot obtain satisfaction from the assets of its members; the liability of the members or shareholders is limited to the capital invested by them; similarly, the creditors of the members have no right to the assets of the corporation. This position has been well established ever since the decision in the case of Salomon v. Salomon & Co. was pronounced in 1897; and indeed, it has always been the well- recognised principle of common law.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"144. With this principle in mind, the doctrine of piercing the veil of a corporate entity has to be appreciated, as the object of it is to make those behind the veil i.e. the shareholders, liable for the debts of the company. In Balwant Rai Saluja (supra), where the issue, whether employees of a contractor engaged in statutory canteens would be treated as employees of principal employer came up for consideration, the contractor being the 150/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Hotel Corporation of India Limited (""HCI""), which was a subsidiary of Air India. The contention advanced was that HCI was a sham and camouflage subsidiary of Air India and, hence, it was a fit case to pierce the corporate veil.

While dismissing the appeal, by holding that employees of HCI could be held to be workmen of Air India, the Apex Court remarked as below :-

""70. The doctrine of ""piercing the corporate veil"" stands as an exception to the principle that a company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its shareholders within its own legal rights and obligations. It seeks to disregard the separate personality of the company and attribute the acts of the company to those who are allegedly in direct control of its operation.
71. In recent times, the law has been crystallised around the six principles formulated by Mumby, J. In Ben Hashem v. Ali Shayif [Ben Hashem v. Ali Shayif,2008 EWHC 2380 (Fam)]. The six principles, as found at paras 159-64 of the case are as follows :
i. Ownership and control of a company were not enough to justify piercing the corporate veil;
ii. The court cannot pierce the corporate veil, even in the absence of third-party interests in the company, namely, because it is thought to be necessary in the interests of justice; iii. The corporate veil can be pierced only if there is some impropriety;
iv. The impropriety in question must be linked to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liability; v. To justify piercing the corporate veil, there must be both control of the company by the wrongdoer(s) and impropriety, that is use or misuse of the company by them as a device or facade to conceal their wrongdoing; and vi. The company may be a ""facade"" even though it was not originally incorporated with any deceptive intent, provided that it is being used for the purpose of deception at the time of the relevant transactions. The court would, however, pierce the corporate veil only so far as it was necessary in order to provide a remedy for the particular wrong which those controlling the company had done.
73. The position of law regarding this principle in India has been enumerated in various decisions. A Constitution Bench of this Court in LIC v. Escorts Ltd. [(1986) 1 SCC 264], while discussing the doctrine of corporate veil, held that :
151/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""90. ...Generally and broadly speaking, we may say that the corporate veil may be lifted where a statute itself contemplates lifting the veil, or fraud or improper conduct is intended to be prevented, or a taxing statute or an beneficent statute is sought to be evaded or where associated companies are inextricably connected as to be, in reality, part of one concern. It is neither necessary nor desirable to enumerate the classes of cases where lifting the veil is permissible, since that must necessarily depend on the relevant statutory or other provisions, the object sought to be achieved, the impugned conduct, the involvement of the element of the public interest, the effect on parties who may be affected etc.""
74. Thus, on relying upon the aforesaid decision, the doctrine of piercing the veil allows the court to disregard the separate legal personality of a company and impose liability upon the persons exercising real control over the said company. However, this principle has been and should be applied in a restrictive manner, that is, only in scenarios wherein it is evident that the company was a mere camouflage or sham deliberately created by the persons exercising control over the said company for the purpose of avoiding liability. The intent of piercing the veil must be such that would seek to remedy a wrong done by the persons controlling the company, the application would thus depend upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"145. Considering the nature of control exercised by parent company over its subsidiary, when the Court was called upon to pierce the corporate veil in Vodafone International Holdings BV (supra), the Court refused to do so, by clarifying that merely because a parent company might have some ability to persuade its subsidiary do not make the two entities one and in this background, the doctrine received a further expansion in the following way :-

""101. A company is a separate legal persona and the fact that all its shares are owned by one person or by the parent company has nothing to do with its separate legal existence. If the owned company is wound up, the liquidator, and not its parent company, would get hold of the assets of the subsidiary. In none of the authorities have assets of the subsidiary been held to be those of the parent unless it is acting as an agent. Thus, even though a subsidiary may normally comply with the request of a parent company, it is not just a puppet of the parent company. The difference is between having power or having a persuasive position. Though it may be advantageous for parent and subsidiary companies to work as a group, each subsidiary will look to see 152/168 CARBP-414-18.odt whether there are separate commercial interests which should be guarded.
102. When there is a parent company with subsidiaries, is it or is it not the law that the parent company has the ""power"" over the subsidiary. It depends on the facts of each case. For instance, take the case of a one-man company, where only one man is the shareholder perhaps holding 99% of the shares, his wife holding 1%. In those circumstances, his control over the company may be so complete that it is his alter ego. But,in case of multinationals it is important to realise that their subsidiaries have a great deal of autonomy in the country concerned except where subsidiaries are created or used as a sham. Of course, in many cases the courts do lift up a corner of the veil but that does not mean that they alter the legal position between the companies.
103. The Directors of the subsidiary under their articles are the managers of the companies. If new Directors are appointed even at the request of the parent company and even if such Directors were removable by the parent company, such Directors of the subsidiary will owe their duty to their companies (subsidiaries). They are not to be dictated by the parent company if it is not in the interests of those companies (subsidiaries). The fact that the parent company exercises shareholders' influence on its subsidiaries cannot obliterate the decision-making power or authority of its (subsidiary's) Directors. They cannot be reduced to be puppets. The decisive criterion is whether the parent company's management has such steering interference with the subsidiary's core activities that the subsidiary can no longer be regarded to perform those activities on the authority of its own executive Directors.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"146. In K.K.Modi Investment & Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. Apollo International Inc. & Ors.45, the Delhi High Court was considering whether an arbitration clause could be enforced against non-signatories merely on the ground of economic unity between the entities/persons and in answering the question in the negative, it reiterated that merely because companies may have parent-subsidiary relationships and have a common management, would not lead to the presumption that all the companies are one entity. The relevant paragraph of the decision clarify as under :-

45 (2009) 2 Arb LR 499 153/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""5. The first requirement of Section 7 is that there should be a contract between petitioner and respondent, if there is no contract between petitioner and respondent the arbitration clause between them cannot be inferred. In the present case, the contract is there only between petitioner and respondent no. 1 in the form of a Shareholders' Agreement. There is no contract between petitioner and respondents no.2, 3 & 4. Can such a contract be inferred between petitioner and respondents no.2, 3 & 4 merely on the ground of economic unity of respondents 1 to 4 ? Every company which is incorporated under the relevant law of a country is a separate legal entity/person having right to enter into contracts with other legal entities of persons independent of the holding company or the parent company of which it is subsidiary. Unless the law provides that all companies having common management or subsidiary companies or holding Companies shall be considered one legal entity for the purpose of contracts, the Court cannot presume that all subsidiary companies and the holding or parent company shall be considered as one legal person and a contract with one company shall be considered as a contract with every other company of that group. If it is so, then the registration of separate companies as subsidiary companies or wholly owned companies would have no meaning and the Court would be effectively merging all subsidiary companies wholly or partly owned companies into one company. That is not the position under company law or any other law that a subsidiary company practically has no legal existence and it is only the main company which has legal existence. A contract with respondent no. 1 cannot be considered as a contract with respondents no.2, 3 & 4. If respondents no.2, 3 & 4 were to be considered one and the same person then there was no reason for the petitioner to enter into contract with only a subsidiary company. The petitioner should have entered into a contract with main company. The very fact that the petitioner entered into a contract with subsidiary company on the basis of an agreement of respondent no.1 with respondent no.3, shows that the petitioner knew that respondents no.1 & 3 were two different legal persons and he was entering into contract with respondent no.1 or not with respondents no.2, 3 or 4. The contract between respondent no.1 & 3 cannot be considered as contract between petitioner and respondents no.1 & 3 on the ground of economic unity of respondents no.1 & 3. By the notice dated 22.4.2009 the respondent no. 3 had terminated the license, which it granted to respondent no. 1 under a separate contract which was entered into between respondents no.1 & 3. The person aggrieved can only be respondent no.1 who could have invoked arbitration clause contained in the license agreement against respondent no.3.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"In deciding that the veil could not be pierced on the facts before the court, it was held that :-

46 [2010]EWHC 1117 (Admin) 155/168 CARBP-414-18.odt ""Whilst it is plain to me that there is a good arguable case that the £200,000.00 advanced to Prolink by G represented criminal monies, the real question is whether there is a good arguable case that the company's assets should be treated as G's realisable property. It plainly cannot be the case that every injection of criminal funds into a business would result in the corporate veil being lifted, and a restraint order made against the company in terms that its assets were to be treated as those of the criminal. A much closer examination of the facts than that is required. In my judgment, the circumstances of this case are not such that it is appropriate to maintain the restraint order insofar as it relates to the land and property owned by Powervale Limited at Romford Road....The available evidence does not appear to me to show a substantial arguable case of use of a corporate structure as a device or facade to conceal criminal activity in circumstances where substantial trading activity took place to continue an already existing genuine business, and where the loan was openly recorded.",,,,,,,
,,,,"148. In the Indian scenario, on domestic front, in Chloro Controls India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Apex Court was called upon to decide whether party could invoke arbitration in respect of an arbitration agreement to which it was not a signatory and if so, the parameters within which it can invoke arbitration.

Chloro Controls India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) was rendered in the context of an expressed statutory provision in Part II of the Act of 1996 to extend arbitration agreement to non- signatories i.e. Section 45 of the Act which enumerated the power of judicial authority to refer party to the arbitration and with reference to Section 44, it contemplated that a judicial authority shall, at the request of one of the parties or any person claiming through or under him, refer parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

156/168 CARBP-414-18.odt The Apex Court permitted the impleadment of the parties at the pre-arbitration stage, but it also reiterated that ordinarily arbitration would take place only between the persons, who are parties to the arbitration agreement and the substantive contract underlining it. However, in certain circumstances, a non-signatory could be subjected to arbitration without its prior consent, but it would be only in exceptional circumstances.

Such circumstances included a case, where it could be demonstrated that it was a mutual intention of all the parties to bind the signatories and non-signatories such as when a composite transaction has been entered into, which necessarily includes the performance of the parent agreement alongwith the subsidiary agreement. However, in the subsequent decision of Cox and Kings Limited (supra), it is specifically held that the principle of piercing the corporate veil cannot be the sole basis for impleading a non-signatory under the Group of Companies doctrine and it would require something more such as the common intention of the parties to participate in the transaction.

The recent pronouncement in Cox and Kings Limited revolve around the definition of ""parties"" under Section 2(1)

(h) read with Section 7 of the Act of 1996, to include both signatory as well as non-signatory parties, although the conduct of the non-signatory parties was held to be an indicator of their consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement. Drawing a distinction between the concept of ""party"", which is distinct and different from the concept of ""persons claiming through or under a party to the arbitration 157/168 CARBP-414-18.odt agreement"", it was held that the underlying basis for the application of Group of Companies doctrine rests on maintaining the corporate separateness of the group companies while determining the common intention of the parties to bind the non-signatory to the arbitration agreement. The Constitution Bench, categorically ruled that the principle of alter ego or piercing the corporate veil cannot be the basis for the application of the Group of Companies doctrine, which has an independent existence as a principle of law which stems from a harmonious reading of Section 2(1)(h) alongwith Section 7 of the Act of 1996.

The approach of the Supreme Court in Chloro Controls India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to the extent that it traced the Group of Companies doctrine to the phrase ""claiming through or under""

is held to be erroneous and against the well established principles of contract law and corporate law. By setting the law straight, it is pronounced that the Group of Companies doctrine should be retained in the Indian arbitration jurisprudence, considering its utility in determining the intention of the parties in the context of complex transactions involving multiple parties and multiple agreements.
The Apex Court emphasized the onus on the party seeking the impleadment of non-signatory to the agreement in order to rope it in the arbitral proceedings and it was held to be permissible only when a strong case on facts and in law was made out. If the high burden to subject a non-signatory to arbitration is made, the consequence would be that the non-
signatory participate     in    the   arbitration    and      avail      an opportunity to present its case. However, in the present scenario when the Respondent Nos.2 to 4 were not parties to the arbitration proceedings and since they are not even parties to the award, merely because it is alleged that the Respondent Nos.2 to 4 with an intention to divest Respondent No.1 of its asset, so that the petitioner is not in a position to get the award enforced/executed, by playing a fraud, is not a sufficient ground to lift the veil as it is a bald pleading that the assets were transferred to avoid the liability under the awards.
140. As far as the facts of the case are concerned, I have already noted that the Respondent No.1 was incorporated in the year 1999, whereas the Master Agreement with the petitioner was entered into on 28/9/2008. The Respondent No.4 was incorporated on 29/9/2000, with an object to invest, hold and acquire shares and other securities, thus essentially making it a holding company.
On the date when the Master Agreement was entered into, Respondent No.4 was not even in existence, and admittedly, it is not signatory to it.
When the Petitioner seek to pierce the corporate veil between Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.4 and want to hold it liable for the debts of the former, it definitely cannot rest its case on commonality of shareholding and management as it is not sufficient that two entities share a parent and subsidiary relationship.
Merely being a group company cannot result in making an independent company liable for its debts, in absence of any material particulars being revealed to prove that respondent no.4 was responsible for fraud and the Corporate structure is used to perpetrate the fraud. The      Respondent      No.4   is   a   distinct      legal     entity
incorporated in the year 2000 with the purpose of being an 'investment company' having its distinct business from the business of the other respondents, which are engaged in the business of entertaining and real estate. Upon the demerger of Respondent No.1, into resulting entities, i.e. Respondent Nos.2 and 3, the Respondent No.4 did not become the owner of any assets of Respondent No.1 and even as on date, it is the specific case of Respondent No.4 that its assets are distinct from that of Respondent Nos.1 to 3. The Respondent No.4's shareholding in Respondent Nos.2 and 3, from inception has been its asset, as Respondent No.4 was a member of Respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3, but it is not the owner of the assets of these Companies.

The partial final award on jurisdiction and quantum by the ICC has exhaustively dealt with the jurisdictional issue in the wake of the objection raised by the Respondent to the effect that IMAX Ltd. had no legal status pursuant to the corporate law to initiate proceedings in that name in 2004, similarly, IMAX had no capacity in 2004 to appoint an attorney to act on its behalf in connection with such proceedings.

""Respondent's application is without merit. As demonstrated in the accompanying statement of the Honorable James Farley, Q.C., this issue is a matter of form, not substance. At best, this is a minor and technical error that can be easily corrected. When Imax Ltd. was amalgamated into Imax Corporation, all of the rights that Imax Ltd. Had under the Master Agreement continued in Imax Corporation. This is not a situation where rights to enforce the Master Agreement have somehow disappeared, as Imax Ltd. continues to exist under Imax Corporation. Under Canadian law, this situation would be quickly remedied by permitting the caption of this case to be changed to substitute Imax Corporation for Imax Ltd. Claimant respectfully submits this application to the Panel pursuant to Article 19 of the ICC Rules to substitute or join Imax Corporation as Claimant and respectfully submits that the Panel should allow this substitutions to make what is essentially a ministerial change in the interest of justice and efficiency.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"The ICC referred to Canada Business Corporation Act (CBCA) and in particular, Section 186 and took note of the difference of view of the two experts as to the proper interpretation of Section 186 of CBCA, which included the opinion of Mr.Lenczner QC and Mr.Farley QC.",,,,,,,
,,,,"154. 38. It was suggested by Mr Coomaraswamy SC, that even if the Tribunal accepted Mr.Farley QC's Opinion, given the ICC procedures for approval of any Award, it was not open to us, as arbitrators, to change the title of the Final Partial Award and of the Arbitration. The Respondent's application under Article 6.2 of the ICC Rules raises a fundamental question of jurisdiction and invites the 165/168 CARBP-414-18.odt Tribunal to rule that this Arbitration and the Final Partial Award is a nullity because IMAX Limited had no legal status or power to make the Reference to Arbitration and to conduct the arbitration as required by the ICC Rules. The Claimant says that all that has happened is that the arbitration has been commenced and conducted in the wrong name. That is the essential dispute which the Tribunal has resolved in the Claimant's favour. It would, to adopt the language of Persona, make no sense if, in resolving that dispute, the Tribunal had no power to grant the relief which necessarily follows, namely to change the name of the Claimant, not of course, its identity. The Tribunal plainly has the power to declare that IMAX Ltd is IMAX Corporation and does so.""

This view being the most plausible view and as the Tribunal has already concluded this issue in the partial final award on jurisdiction and quantum, I do not deem it appropriate to interfere with the said decision on merits, by invoking Section 48(1)(a) or (d) of the Arbitration Act, as it would be amounting to review of the decision on merits.",,,,,,,
,,,,"155. In the wake of the finding recorded by me on the above issues/points, which arose for consideration, I conclude by holding that the subject contract entered between the Petitioner and the Respondent No.1, was a contract contingent upon the approval of Reserve Bank of India and IMAX had acknowledged this fact and agreed for any reasonable restructuring, as long as it did not negatively impact it in a material fashion. Admittedly, no prior approval of Reserve Bank of India was received and the transaction could not be completed. The ICC has awarded the damages on the premise that RBI's approval could have come, but the fact remains that it never came. Since, according to me, as held above, the necessity of RBI's approval was imperative and obtaining such an approval was in tune with the FEMA, in not adhering to its requirement and acting in violation of it's provision, is a 166/168 CARBP-414-18.odt matter of public policy, and since in the wake of the statutory provision under Section 48(2)(b), the enforcement of the award, which is contrary to the public policy shall be refused by the Court, I am rejecting the relief sought in the Petition by the Petitioner, seeking enforcement of the awards.",,,,,,,

Identical relief has been sought in the above suits namely a perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant from publicly performing or in any manner communicating the sound recordings of the songs assigned and authorized to PPL and Novex respectively without obtaining licences from PPL and Novex.","2. A preliminary issue has been raised by the Defendants in the above suits namely that Novex and PPL cannot carry on the business of issuing licenses without being registered as a Copyright Society under Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act, 1957 (""the Act"") and thus, the Suit as filed will not entitle PPL and Novex to any kind of relief.","5. Mr. Darius Khambata, has made submissions with regard to the scheme of the Copyright Act, which is divided into various chapters and each chapter deals with a different topic. He has referred to the meaning of the term ""Copyright"" and the rights associated with it covered in Chapter III of the Act, under Section 14. This defines a copyright to mean the exclusive right to reproduce a literary, dramatic or musical work in any material form including storing by electronic varsha 14 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc means, to make copies of such a work to perform it in public and in the case of a sound recording it includes the right to sell or give on commercial rentals or to communicate the sound recording to the public. He has submitted that the rights of the owner of copyright and its associate rights are covered in Chapter IV of the Act. Ownership of the copyright can be acquired in 4 broad ways. These are as under:-

i) By the author himself, being the first owner under Section 17;
ii) Situations in which the author creates a work in the course of his employment etc. for the benefit or on behalf of someone else, also under Section 17;
iii) Through an assignment under Sections 18 and 19 and
iv)Through testamentary disposition under Section 20.",,"4. Mr. Darius Khambata, learned Senior Counsel has made submissions on behalf of Novex which are supported by the Counsel whose appearances have been mentioned above. Whereas Mr. Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel for PPL has made submissions on behalf of the PPL supported by the Counsel whose appearances are referred above.","6. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the aforementioned categories confer full and absolute ownership on the author/owner/assignee, as the case may be. Thus, the owner of the copyright could be an assignee. All the incidents of rights that are available to an owner are also available to an assignee. The rights are not higher or lower merely by virtue of the ownership rights being acquired through assignment. The Defendants termed the Plaintiffs as ""Aggregators"" whatever their characterization, in law, the Plaintiffs are as much owner as any other form of owner.","52. Mr. Khambata has submitted that when an owner takes an assignment of copyright, the object is to take ownership of the copyright. The consideration which prompted that is not the object or purpose of the contract. Analysis of the contracts entered into by Novex will show that the contracts have not even said anything about the assignment being taken for the purpose of business of granting license. Even assuming the contract did say that the contract was for the purpose of doing the business of granting license that would only describe the motive of the contract i.e. the reason Novex desired to take the assignment but that motive would still not be the object of the contract. Thus, Defendants' contention that if Novex has taken an assignment solely for the purpose of doing business, in licensing, then the assignment is for an unlawful object and therefore void, under Section 23 of the Contract Act, is misconceived.

,,,"3. Thus the issue which falls for determination prior to going into merits of each of the above suits, is whether PPL and Novex in the above suits are entitled to seek reliefs as sought for in the plaint without being registered as a Copyright Society under Section 33 (1) of the Act.",7. Mr. Khambata has referred to Section 18(2) of the Act wherein it is provided that the assignee shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner of copyright and the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly.,,"12. Mr. Khambata has submitted that such a scheme provided under the Act would have been totally unnecessary if the Defendants were correct in their contention that it was only a ""registered copyright society"" which could carry on such business of issuing or granting licences. Accepting the Defendant's submission as pleaded and argued would amount to rendering this scheme meaningless.","13. Mr. Khambata, thereafter, referred to the Scope and object of the 1994 Amendment. By the 1994 Amendment a new chapter - Chapter VII was introduced, which deals with 'copyright society'. He has submitted that the object of 1994 Amendment was to promote the Collective administration of rights through a Copyright Society, both varsha 17 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc for the benefit of the owner as well as general public. The copyright societies, on an ""authorization"" from the owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. As such, a Copyright Society fundamentally operated to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"". He has submitted that by its very nature therefore, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) an authorized agent and (ii) an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. He has submitted that reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses together with Sections 33 to 36 which have been introduced by 1994 Amendment Act was was merely to provide for registration and to regulate functioning of copyright societies. The amendments so introduced did not in any manner affect and/or circumscribe the rights of an owner to conduct its own affairs including granting of licenses by such owner. The ""sea change"" as sought to be contended by the Defendants is absolutely not evident from the 1994 Amendment or Notes on Clauses in this regard.","59. Mr. Kadam has submitted that PPL's repertoire has a majority of works over which it is the owner. These are two compelling reasons and factors because of which the Court ought to exercise its discretion under Section 61(1) to hold that it is not necessary to make the 11 music labels who are Licensors/Owners of the works as party Defendants to the Suit.
",,131. Mr. Shenoy has also joined in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar and other counsel for Defendants in submitting that the Plaintiffs have no right to maintain the present suit and that this Court dismiss the Plaintiffs Interim Application.,
,,,"51. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants' contentions are that the Assignment Agreements are illegal and erroneous. The Assignment Deeds have been executed for a substantial consideration between the music labels and Novex for transferring the 'on ground performance rights' in consonance with Section 18 of the Act. He has submitted that all that the Suit is concerned, is whether Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright and whether Novex has a right to prevent the infringement of its exclusive Copyright. Therefore, if it is held that Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright then what logically follows is that the Defendants have to be injuncted from infringing upon Novex's exclusive Copyright. This varsha 36 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc would be irrespective of whether or not there is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing Novex from carrying out the business of issuing licenses of its Copyrights.

","8. Mr. Khambata has also referred to Section 18 (1) of the Act which specifically recognizes the owner's right to assign his copyright either wholly or partially, to any person.",,"24. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Owner's right under Section 30 cannot be curtailed by Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that Defendants have alleged that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an owner of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. He has submitted that such an interpretation is ex facie incorrect because :

i) If the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendant is accepted, then Section 33(1) completely takes away the right granted by Section 30 of the Act. In such a case, Section 33(1) would effectively emasculate Section 30;
ii) Further, if Defendant's interpretation is accepted then a section in a chapter dealing with copyright varsha 24 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies would completely subordinate and emasculate the right of an owner under Section 30, a section which falls in a different Chapter dealing with licensing. If Parliament had intended to take away any part of the owner's right under Section 30 (even by subjecting it to the compulsory agency of a registered copyright society) then an express amendment to Section 30 would have been essential.","17. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent.","62. Mr. Kadam has submitted that in view of the aforementioned, the primary objective of copyright and provisions relating to copyright is being for the benefit and enjoyment and protection of the owner. He has also placed reliance on an extract from Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright Volume I, page 1503, Paragraphs 18-28 in this context.
",,"164. Prima facie, I find that there is much merit in the submission on behalf of PPL and Novex that the above suits have been filed against the Defendants who are rank infringes as they have failed to obtain a license in respect of the works which they are exploiting. The present suits concern whether PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright and whether they have a right to prevent infringement of their exclusive copyright. This in my view would be irrespective of whether or not these is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing them from carrying on business of issuing licenses in respect of their copyright. In the event it is held that PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright then it would follow that the Defendants have to be prevented from infringing the copyright.",
,,,,9. Mr. Khambata has referred to the Right of an owner of copyright to license its work under Chapter VI of the Act. Under section 30 of the Chapter VI of the Act the Licences by owners of copyright have been provided. The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:,,28. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is also well settled that a statute is required to be harmoniously construed so that each provision is given effect to without defeating and/or destroying another.,"23. Mr. Khambata has referred to extract from Copinger and Skone James at Page 1540, wherein it is stated that the norm is that copyright licensing is done individually by the owners. It is only in situations where it becomes difficult or impossible for an owner to license his works individually that the need for Copyright Societies arises. The rationale for Copyright Societies is that it is the best means of protecting owners rights. Such Societies offer a facility to owners; they do not denude the owners of any of their rights.","126. Mr. Narula has thereafter referred to the Copyright (Second Amendment) Bill, 1992 introduced in Loksabha is on 16 th July 1992. He has in this context referred to the statement of objects and reasons and the Notes on Clauses appended to the 1992 Bill which clearly shows the intent of 1992 Bill. This was revised and modified by the Legislature before the enactment of the 1994 Amendment. He has submitted that it is important to note that Section 33(1) as proposed in the 1992 Bill did not contain the 1 st 40 [(1997) 2 SCC 820] varsha 68 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso to Section 33(1). The same was introduced subsequently. Therefore, it is obvious that the legislative intent initially was to impose a complete prohibition on any person or association to carry on the business of issuing or granting license except in accordance to the registration granted under Section 33(3) of the Act.
",,"165. Accordingly, the issue as to whether PPL and Novex as Plaintiffs in the above suits are entitled to seek reliefs as varsha 86 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act is answered in the affirmative.",
,,,,"10. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Section 30 applies to an ""owner"". An ""owner"" as is clear from Section 18(2) and as mentioned above includes an ""assignee"". Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers ""duly authorized agent"" of the owner, to grant license. He has referred to Section 30 (A) of the Act and has submitted that this makes it very clear that the provisions of Section 30 apply to licensing in the same way as the provisions of Section 19 apply to an assignment. Therefore, the Act allows an ""owner"" to grant a license directly or through an agent under Section 30 and then sets out the varsha 16 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc procedure for licensing by specifying that what applies to assignment would apply to licensing as well.",,"40. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the defendants have contended that the words 'individual capacity' in Section 33(1) is the opposite of business and therefore an owner licensing his works in his individual capacity would not be doing business as per Section 33(1) of the Act. He has submitted that this argument is also completely untenable since there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the words individual capacity is the opposite of business. He has submitted that a company can also do business in its individual capacity. He has submitted that the use of the expression ' carrying on business' must be interpreted contextually. The same would not cover the owners' activity of carrying on business and include carrying on business of issuing licenses in its own name but in which others hold copyright. Hence, the expression ""individual capacity"" in Section 33(1) must be interpreted as meaning only anything opposed to ""collective capacity""

i.e. through a society. That is collective administration of owner's rights.

Mr. Khambata has submitted that the word 'business' has no technical meaning but is to be read with reference to the object and context of the Act in which it occurs. The interpretation necessarily has to be ""contextual"". He has submitted that for this purpose it is 3 AIR 1961 SC 112 4Order dated 17th July 2014 in NOM (L) No.1451 of 2014 in Suit (L) No.603 of 2014; 2014 SCC OnLine Bom 1324.","129. Mr. P. Shenoy, learned counsel for the Defendant in Commercial Suit No. 37362 of 2022, has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapur and has relied upon the 'Mischief Rule' of Statutory Interpretation, which has also been highlighted by Mr. Khambata in his submissions on behalf of Novex. He has also referred to the functions associated with the business of ""Collective Administration of Copyright"" and has submitted that what PPL did when they were varsha 69 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc registered as a copyright society and what they continue to do today (when not registered as a Copyright Society), through the artifice of taking limited partial assignments, is the same. He has referred to ""Copinger and Skone James"" (supra) on Copyright, which articulates the difference between ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" and ""Collective Administration of Rights"". He has submitted that an ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" is where each rightholder of copyright enters into agreements with prospective users of his work without ""banding together"" with other rightholders. Moreover, when it comes to certain categories of copyright, individual right holders may ""band together to exercise rights on a Collective basis"" This would involve all the individual rightholders pooling in their individual works to create a common repertoire of works in a single entity, which repertoire is then provided to a prospective user through that single entity. Any entity which manages this repertoire of works pooled together by individual rightholders, whether through assignment of ownership, licensing or agency in common parlance is considered to be a ""collecting society"" or a ""licensing body"",
",,,
,,,,"11. Mr. Khambata has referred to Sections 31, 31(A) to 31(D) of the Act which give a whole scheme of regulations for granting licenses compulsorily to the public. These sections fetter the right of the owner in the matter of grant of licences. He has submitted that the scheme of these sections contemplates notice to be issued to the ""owner"" to secure such licences thereby recognizing the primacy of the ""owner's right to licence"". The term owner is used in these sections not a ""registered copyright society"". These Sections of the Act envisage that it is the ""owner"" of the Copyright who is entitled to grant licenses for consideration and if he charges an exorbitant consideration, there is a remedy provided in the Act itself. It is the ""owner"" who is also entitled to be heard and to be paid.",,"41. Mr. Khambata has thereafter referred to the second Proviso to Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that prior to 2012 Amendment by which the second proviso was added to Section 33(1), the authors of the underlying work lost their rights to their works to the owners of the sound recording or the owners of the cinematograph film who had employed them to create the underlying work. In order to correct this specific mischief a proviso was added to Section 17 as well as Section 18 as per the 2012 Amendment Act. These provisos stated that even if an individual who has authored a work has been employed by someone else i.e. the owner of the copyright, the authors' rights to the underlying work would not be affected by the ownership of the copyright by the employer. He has referred to Minister's speech tabling the 2012 Amendment and has submitted that the second proviso was introduced to assuage the grievances and/or concerns of the ""author"" community and this can also be culled out from the statement of objects and reasons to the said amendment.","31. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants have contended that ""business"" must be given the widest possible meaning and as such anything that is ""business"", including the grant of licenses varsha 27 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc by the owner is covered by Section 33 (1). He submitted that such a contention is completely counterproductive and in fact militates against the case of the Defendants. The wider the interpretation of the term ""business"", the greater the intrusion on the right available to the owner under Section 30. If business is interpreted as put forth by the Defendants, then in that case, 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy.","145. Thus, this decision of the Supreme Court makes it clear that Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner. It only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.

","34. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the different chapters in an Act cover different demarcated aspects. Chapter VII of the Act covers 'Copyright Societies' and further expounds on the conditions of varsha 28 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the registration and other associated aspects, whereas Chapter VI of the Act creates a statutory right of licensing. He has submitted that a section which comes under Chapter VII dealing with copyright societies cannot in effect, take away a right granted under a completely different chapter. Particularly when the ""clearest of language"" in this regard as used in the second proviso is absent.",,,,
,,,,"14. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is necessary to refer in this context to Section 33 of Chapter VII of the Act, which is reproduced as under:-

Section 33 of the Act provides as follows;
""33. Registration of Copyright society.-- (1) No person or association of persons shall, after coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994 (38 of 1994) commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licences in respect of any work in which varsha 18 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc copyright subsists or in respect of any other rights conferred by this Act except under or in accordance with the registration granted under sub-section (3):
Provided that an owner of copyright shall, in his individual capacity, continue to have the right to grant licences in respect of his own works consistent with his obligations as a member of the registered copyright society:
Provided further that the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under this Act:
Provided also that a performing rights society functioning in accordance with the provisions of section 33 on the date immediately before the coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994 (38 of 1994) shall be deemed to be a copyright society for the purposes of this Chapter and every such society shall get itself registered within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994.",,"43. Mr. Khambata has submitted that what is significant to note in the 2nd proviso is that there is a complete embargo on carrying on the business of issuing or granting license in respect of the underlying work and this business can be carried out ""only"" through a copyright society. Therefore, it is clear that when the legislature specifically wanted rights of owners / authors to be curtailed, there was a specific, clear and unambiguous provision. This language is absent in Section 33(1). He further submitted that if the Defendants argument is accepted that Section 33(1) prevented all owners, including authors, from doing the business of granting license of copyright, then there would be no need of the second proviso.",39. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the first proviso to Section 33(1) uses the phrase 'individual capacity'. He has submitted that the term individual capacity should not be considered to be equivalent to exercise of rights by individual authors or owners personally. It should rather be understood to mean any method other than collective management whereby right holders make their own decisions about exercise of the rights in the works.,,,,
,,,,(2) Any association of persons who fulfils such conditions as may be prescribed may apply for permission to do the business specified in sub-section (1) to the Registrar of Copyrights who shall submit the varsha 19 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc application to the Central Government.,,"44. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the second proviso was needed since the Parliament was clear that Section 33(1) did not prevent all owners including authors from licensing their copyrights for profit and since parliament wanted to draw distinction between the authors and the owners the second proviso became necessary. Hence it is specifically mentioned that licensing by the authors of the underlying works will only be done by the copyright society.","49. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the argument of the Defendants is that the assignment is obtained by the plaintiff for the purpose of issuing and granting licenses and therefore cannot be enforced before this Court in view of Section 33(1). Since there is no varsha 35 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc bar in the Act in obtaining an assignment, at best and without prejudice to the argument elucidated above and, in the alternative, the bar would kick in only in respect of the actual grant or issuance of licenses. That will not affect the right of an owner independently to bring a suit for infringement of copyright and seek reliefs.",,,,
,,,,"(3) The Central Government may, having regard to the interests of the authors and other owners of rights under this Act, the interest and convenience of the public and in particular of the groups of persons who are most likely to seek licences in respect of the relevant rights and the ability and professional competence of the applicants, register such association of persons as a copyright society subject to such conditions as may be prescribed:

Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works. (3A)...
(4)...
(5)...",,"45. Mr. Khambata has submitted that if the second proviso to Section 33(1) is clarificatory (as argued by the Defendants), this would mean that the Parliament only wished to clarify this position for underlying works and not for any other works. Therefore even this case as canvassed by the Defendants militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded by them. He has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. varsha 33 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Commissioner of Central Excise"".7 at Paragraph 21 held that 'Parliament is deemed to know the law and therefore the fact that the Parliament has amended Section 33(1) in 2012 by adding the second proviso shows that Parliament itself did not think Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works'.","50. Mr. Khambata has submitted that another fact is that the Defendants have no independent right of its own. They are rank infringers. The Defendants have not even attempted to justify their entitlement in exploiting the subject sound recordings and has merely sought to assail Novex's entitlement to seek reliefs on the ground that Novex is not a registered copyright society. Once it is observed that the right to seek relief for infringement is not jeopardized, the relief as sought by Novex must follow. This is clear from a reading of Sections 13, 14 r/w. 51 (a)(i).",,,,
,,,,"15. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the heading of Section 34 is clear that it deals with 'Administration of rights of an owner by a copyright society'. Thus, it it is somebody else's rights which are being administered and that owner can be an author, employer, proprietor, an assignee or someone who inherits it. Therefore, the copyright society is acting in a capacity similar to a manager/agent while administering the rights of the owner.",,"46. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Phonographic Performance Limited v. Avion Hospitality Pvt Ltd & Ors. has set aside the view taken by a Learned Single Judge of this Court in ""Phonographic Performance Ltd vs City Organisers Pvt. Ltd."".8 which had accepted the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendants. The Division Bench in ""Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd."" (supra) accepted the interpretation placed by counsel for the Plaintiff on Section 33 read with Section 34 of the Act and had found that the learned Judge's attention was not invited to several provisions of the Act from which it can be construed that the Plaintiff-Novex has locus to file the suit or claim injunction.","57. Mr. Kadam has submitted that one of the objections raised by the Defendant is that PPL cannot sue without joining the owner in respect of the exclusively licensed works. He has referred to Section 54 of the Act, which provides that unless the context otherwise requires, the expression ""owner of copyright""

shall include an ""exclusive licensee"". Further Section 55 provides that where the copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright shall be entitled to all such remedies including an injunction. From a reading of Section 55 with Section 54, an exclusive licensee would be entitled as an owner of copyright for the purposes of Chapter XII to institute a Suit and seek an injunction in relation to an infringement of copyright in any work covered by the exclusive license.",,,,
,,,,"16. Mr. Khambata has referred to Section 34(1)(a) which deals with the manner in which a copyright society would obtain varsha 20 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc authorization for administration which clearly conveys the intention to include both, the author and other owners of right which would include an 'assignee'. Further, Section 34(1)(b) of the Act contemplates that an author or other owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This shows that an author or other owner does not have to carry out the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).",,"47. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd."".9 does not assist the Defendant. He has submitted that the Madras High Court in the said decision has erroneously framed an issue whether Novex is entitled to grant licenses or not. The subject matter of the dispute before the Madras High Court was whether DXC Technology was infringing Novex's copyright or not, it wasn't whether 7[2016) 3 SCC page 643 8[Comm. Suit No. 740/2017 dated 21.12.2017 9[2021) SCC online MHC 6266 varsha 34 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Novex was entitled to grant licenses or not. He has submitted that the Madras High Court had relied heavily upon the reasons for introducing the 2012 amendment, in support of its decision. The Madras High Court held that a careful examination of Section 18, 30 and 33 show that while the right of the owner in his individual capacity is retained, the right to carry on the ""business of issuing and granting licenses"" is taken away on account of the bar contained in Section 33(1) read with the second proviso. The judgment also holds that the word ""only""","74. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the purported assignment agreements relied upon by the Plaintiffs are void and do not validly transfer actual ownership rights to the Plaintiffs as: (i) they do not identify the ""work"" as required under Section 19(2); (ii) they fall foul of the requirement to specify payment of royalty to authors; (iii) they do not confer actual ownership rights but are designed only to circumvent Section 33(1); and (iv) in case of PPL, there is no assignment/transfer of ownership in respect of 40% of the sound recordings.",,,,
,,,,"18. Mr. Khambata has then referred to Section 35 (1) of the Act, wherein it is provided that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ...""",,"53. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the Assignment Deeds are extremely specific and meet the requirements of Section 19. The Assignment Deeds categorically state that the ownership rights in the works are being assigned to Novex and there is no mention in the Assignment Deeds of the assignment being for the purpose of doing business in licensing. Therefore, the argument of the Defendants that the assignment is solely for the purpose of doing business in licensing must be rejected.

Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have not filed a simpliciter suit for injunction on grounds of infringement. On the contrary, their entire case is that they are entitled to issue licenses and collect license fees. On this basis, they have sought a limited injunction against the Defendants from playing sound recordings without taking a license from the Plaintiffs. This is evident from the Plaintiffs' own pleadings. He has relied upon Paragraphs Nos. 6,9,11,13,28 and 32 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraphs Nos. 4, 6, 9 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by Plaintiff's advocate in respect of the alleged infringement at page no. 59 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraph no. 8 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by 10 Order dated 22nd December 2017 in Commercial Appeal (L) no. 100 of 2017.",,,,

Thus, both Sections 34 and 35 draw a clear distinction between the author/ owner of the right on the one hand and the administrator of that right on the other (i.e. the copyright society) as such has been drawn.",,"54. Mr. Khambata has accordingly submitted that there is no question of there being any impediment in the Plaintiff's entitlement to the reliefs as sought. Equally, the fact that the Plaintiff is not a registered copyright society does not impair its ability to the reliefs as sought.
","83. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL's and Novex's activities fall under Section 33 (1) of the Act and which is apparent from Clauses 3(a), 3(y), 3(z), 3(aa) and 3(ab) of its Memorandum of Association as well as 3.20 and 12 of its Articles of Association. This is also apparent from PPL's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022 which shows that its principal activity is granting 12 [(2016) UKSC 42] varsha 49 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc public performance licenses.

,,,,"20. Mr. Khambata has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"".1 He has submitted that the Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. A Copyright Society steps into the shoes of the author, it issues licenses on behalf of the author and files litigation on his behalf. The Supreme Court goes on to hold that as per Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Therefore, Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner, it only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.",,"55. Mr. Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the PPL has submitted that PPL owns and controls (by Exclusive Licenses) the public performance rights of various music labels which include both, international and domestic recordings. The repertoire of the recordings in which rights are assigned to PPL extend to around 400 labels and more than 45 lakh recordings. PPL issues licenses for public performances / communication to the public of sound recordings on the basis of exclusive rights assigned to it under various assignment agreements by these music labels. He has submitted that PPL has Assignment agreements with 60% of the labels in its repertoire whereby the following rights have been assigned exclusively to PPL. These Agreements can be found on the official website of PPL. Further, he has submitted that with respect to 11 labels, PPL is the 'Exclusive Licensee' of the copyright in the sound recordings. Barring these 11 labels, for all the other labels i.e. 393 of 404, PPL has Assignment Deeds executed for the copyright in the sound recordings.

Mr. Kadam has submitted that if the argument of the Defendants that the 'business' of licensing can be conducted only through a copyright society is to be accepted then, it would only be the Copyright Society who would be in a position to maintain a suit for infringement. The Defendants' have failed to address the issue that no conditions have been introduced in Section 51 and Section 19 for exercise of rights by the Copyright Owner at the time when the Copyright Society chapter was introduced in the Act. He has accordingly submitted that the PPL in the present case has exercised its rights as an owner and is not administering the rights of others. This has been overlooked by the Defendants in their arguments. He has accordingly submitted that PPL by exercising its rights as owner is able to seek reliefs as sought for in the above suits.
","96. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that after noticing the problems with the activities of copyright societies introduced by the 1994 Amendment, the Act was further amended in 2012 to incorporate additional provisions for regulation of copyright societies. Elaborate rules were also framed under Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013. He has placed reliance upon the provisions of the Copyright Act and Rules that regulate the business of granting license. He has submitted that it is evident that the Chapter VII of Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules put in place an elaborate regime to regulate the business of issuing licenses. The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the 2012 Amendment also notes that one of the objects for the amendment was to ""make provision for formulation of a tariff scheme by the copyright varsha 55 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies subject to scrutiny by the Copyright Board"". He has also placed reliance upon the 227th Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee dated November 2010 on the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2010 that ultimately led to the 2012 Amendments to the Copyright Act. He has submitted that reference to the above material is appropriate and necessary to ascertain the legislative intent behind Chapter VII of the Copyright Act. Such reference to legislative history has been approved by the Supreme Court in ""R. S. Nayak vs. A. R. Antulay"" 26 wherein it was held that the function of the court is to give effect to the real intention of Parliament. These materials are permissible aids to construction and their denial would deprive the court of substantial and illuminating aid to construction.",,,,

Mr. Khambata has referred to the decision of the The Delhi High Court in the case of Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs Lizard Lounge & Ors.2 The Delhi High Court whilst discussing the role of Copyright 27. ...The creation of Copyright Society is to serve all the three objectives without denuding the author of its own individual rights"" (emphasis supplied)"".
Society and the rights that such Copyright Society can exercise observed that the author being the first owner of the Copyright under section 17 can certainly appoint an agent (Copyright Society) to institute legal proceedings. The Delhi High Court held that :-

""24....The Copyright Society may not have exclusive rights inasmuch as the owner continues to simultaneously have rights to deal with his Copyright in the work...
25.....The Copyright Society is an agent appointed under the agreement by the owner of the Copyright and specific powers have been conferred on the agent to institute legal proceedings. The said Act does not contain any provision prohibiting the institution of legal proceedings in derogation to the general law of agency. The author being the first owner of Copyright under Section 17 of the said Act can certainly appoint an agent to institute legal proceedings.
2 (2009) ILR 2 Delhi 726 Para 24-27.",,"68. Dr. Virendra Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendants in the above suits has submitted that the prohibition imposed by Section 33(1) applies if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) Plaintiff is a "" person or association of persons""; and (ii) Plaintiff carries on business of issuing or granting licenses. He has submitted that both PPL and Novex in the above suits are limited companies and therefore, fall within the meaning of ""persons"". He has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Section 33(1) to suggest that the word ""persons"" excludes owners of copyright. On the contrary, ""persons"" as used in Section 33(1) must include owners because Section 33(1) refers to issuing of licenses. Admittedly, only an owner can issue a license under Section 30 of the Act.

Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the law clearly seeks to address a mischief, i.e., of a person carrying on the business of varsha 57 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc licensing without regulation. He has submitted that the statute must be interpreted to avoid this mischief by following the Heydon's Rule or mischief rule. He has referred to the following cases on this point:

a. The Supreme Court in ""Godawat Pan Masala Products (I) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors"" 28 it was held that for construing a statute, all sections will have to be read together to ascertain what is the mischief sought to be avoided.",,,,
,,,,"25. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ""K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay""3 recognizes the well settled rule of interpretation that two apparently conflicting provisions operating in two different fields should be reconciled, by restricting each to its own object or subject.",,"84. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the clinching factor on this issue is PPL's antecedents. PPL was previously registered as a copyright society under Section 33 of the Copyright Act and admittedly carried on the business of issuing licenses. It applied for re-registration in 2013 but withdrew its application in 2014. It once again applied for re-registration in 2018, which was rejected by the Government on grounds of delay. PPL challenged this rejection before the Delhi High Court. The High Court directed the Government to consider PPL's application on merits. Vide order dated June 9, 2022, the Government rejected PPL's application on the ground that PPL ""has no professional competence to carry on its business and manage its affairs in accordance to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1957 and Copyright Rules, 2013 "". Pertinently, PPL has been carrying on exactly the same business of issuing licenses and collecting license fees. More importantly, the very fact that PPL was previously registered as a society and continued to fight for registration shows that PPL itself is aware that registration is required to carry on the business of licensing.
","109. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not exempt PPL and Novex from the prohibition of Section 33(1). Apart from claiming to be owners, PPL and Novex have not satisfied the conditions of the Proviso viz. (i) Person is an varsha 61 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner of Copyright; ii) Person is acting in his 'individual capacity';",,,,
,,,,"26. Mr. Khambata has then referred to the decision in the case of ""Leopold Café & Stores & Anr. Vs. Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd, 4 wherein the Supreme Court has held that the prohibition as contemplated under Section 33(1) is on conducting business of licensing by a person in its own name for works in which 'others' hold Copyright.",,"125. Mr. Narula has submitted that the legislative intent to remove the basis of the Supreme Court Judgment in ""Indian Performing Rights Society vs. Eastern India Motion Pictures Association""40 and provide independent and non-assignable and non- waivable right of the authors can be best understood from four paragraphs of the Report of the Standing Committee, 227 th Report on Copyright ( Amendment) Bill, 2010. These are paragraphs 9.14 to 9.16 and 9.18 of the Report.
","111. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that it is the contention of PPL and Novex that Section 33(1) is not a prohibition at all and that copyright facilities were merely a facility and option created for the benefit of owners. They have further contended that the 1994 Amendments to the Copyright Act introduced the concept of copyright societies for the first time as facility for owners by enacting Section 33(1). These contentions are plainly incorrect. He has submitted that copyright Societies existed long before the 1994 Amendment. In fact, PPL was founded in 1941 and has been 37 [(1976) 1 SCC 128] 38 [(2018) 14 SCC 161] varsha 62 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc carrying on the same business ever since. The facility of collective management was always available to owners even prior to 1994. Till 1994, there was no regulation on the business of licensing. Section 33(1) that was introduced by the 1994 Amendment brought copyright societies within the regulatory purview and mandated that the business of licensing should only be carried out through a registered entity. He has submitted that the material relied upon through the course of the hearing including the Supreme Court's decision in ""Entertainment Network"" 39, the Parliamentary Debates and extracts from Copinger make it amply clear that the object of copyright societies is not just to promote rights of owners but to balance it with public interest by protecting the interests of users.",,,,
,,,,"necessary to note the heading of Section 33 which is ""Registration of copyright society"". He has submitted that the heading of a section can be used to interpret the object and purpose of a Section. It is well settled that the headings of sections are substantive parts of the act and limit or explain their operation. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati"" (supra) which is the authority for this proposition. He has also referred to the heading of Section 34 of the Act which is ""Administration of rights of owner by copyright society"". He has submitted that Sections 33 and 34 of the Act must be read as respectively restricted to the subject described by these headings. Therefore, if a copyright society wants to do the business of issuing licenses, then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33; this is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling under Chapter VI of the Act.
",,,115. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no valid assignment in favour of the PPL and Novex and thus this cannot be the basis for a suit filed by the Plaintiffs in their capacity as assignees.,,,,
,,,,"29. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Godavat Pan Masala Products I.P. Ltd. vs. Union of India"" 5. The Supreme Court has held as under:

""It is an accepted Canon of Construction of Statutes that a statute must be read as a whole and one 5(2004) 7 SCC 68 Para 29.
provision of the Act should be construed with
reference to other provisions of the same act so as to make a consistent, harmonious enactment of the whole statute. The Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the Clauses to be construed but to the Scheme of the entire statute. The attempt must be to eliminate conflict and to harmonize the different parts of the statute for. It cannot be assumed that Parliament had given by one hand what it took away by the other. (emphasis supplied).
The same principle has been enunciated by the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's (Supra).",,,116. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the argument of PPL and Novex is that the second proviso to Section 33(1) uses the word 'business' and applies only to owners of underlying works. The consequence must be that owners of sound recordings such as PPL and Novex are entitled to carry on business without regulation.,,,,
,,,,"30. Mr. Khambata has submitted that applying these principles, the only interpretation and the way to look at the term 'business' that harmonizes Section 33 with the other sections in the Act would be to construe business as ""business of trading or granting licenses in respect of works which are not owned by such person"" as held by this Court in ""Leopold Cafe"" (Supra). The meaning of ""business"" has to be necessarily such that would not cause violence to other provisions of the Act including Sections 18, 19, 30 and 34.",,,"117. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that this argument is highly flawed. He has submitted that the second proviso is of no relevance to the present matter as it only applies to underlying works incorporated in films or sound recordings. Sound recordings, that are the subject matter of the present dispute, are directly covered by the main enacting provision, i.e., Section 33(1) which refers to ""any work in which copyright subsists"". Thus, the prohibition against owners of sound recordings from carrying on business except through a copyright society can be found in the main section itself without any reference to the second proviso.",,,,
,,,,"32. Mr. Khambata has referred to the definition of Copyright under Rule 2 (c)of the Copyright Rules, 2013. He has submitted that this definition is in wide terms although it also references sub-section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. He has submitted that definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules. It cannot be applied to interpret Section 31(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). He has submitted that if the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Section 30 and 33 of the Act.",,,"121. Mr. Hiren Kamod and Mr. Amit Jamsandekar, amongst other Counsel have made submissions for the Defendants in their respective Suits which are in support of the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar, and in line with his submission.",,,,
,,,,"33. Mr. Khambata has submitted that in any case, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.",,,"122. Mr. Rajiv Narula has made submissions on behalf of the Defendants in Commercial Notice of Motion No. 331 of 2019 in Commercial Suit No. 117 of 2019. He has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act including Section 33 and its Proviso. He has placed reliance upon the legislative debate which had also been relied upon by the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"". (supra). He has in particular has placed reliance upon Paragraph Nos. 38 to 40 and 42 of the said judgment. He has also referred to the 227 th Report on Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 2010 by the Parliamentary Committee.",,,,
,,,,35. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the contention of the Defendants that the later provision i.e. Section 33 would prevail over an earlier provision i.e. Section 30 of the Act has become obsolete in England. Even under Indian law the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's case (supra) made it clear that the rule is to be applied along with several other rules. The Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. It cannot be said that this last rule supersedes every other rule and the only thing that matters for harmonizing or resolving ambiguity is to see which is the latter provision as sought to be argued by the Defendant. The Supreme Court has also held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. If this test is applied the positive clear provision conferring statuary rights upon an owner to grant license is Section 30. Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.,,,"127. Mr. Narula has submitted that the insertion of the definition ""copyright society"" and ""Chapter VIII-Copyright Society""

and the deleting the term ""performing rights society"" is reflected from 1992 Bill. This was in order to widen the scope of collective administration consistent with Clause 11 of the Bill 1992 Bill. He has referred to Clause 2 of the Notes on Clauses of the 1992 Bill in this context. Therefore, the copyright society was not only for the benefits of authors and owners, but also for the general public/users (like the defendants) for whom it is not convenient to obtain licenses.",,,,
,,,,"36. Mr. Khambata has submitted that interpretation leading to unreasonable results must be eschewed. He has in this context placed reliance upon the decision of the UK Supreme Court in "" Gill v Donald Humberstone & Co. Ltd"".6 In the said decision the UK Supreme Court has elucidated the principle that if the language of a section is capable of more than one interpretation then, the Court should avoid natural meaning if it leads to an unreasonable result.",,,,,,,
,,,,"37. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants interpretation on 33 (1) must be eschewed as it will lead to absurd and unreasonable results. If such interpretation is accepted on withdrawal of authority by the owner from the registered copyright society (as is permissible under Section 34(1)(b)) no one will be able to license the work- not even the owner himself. The first proviso to Section 33(1) will place the owner who is a member of a copyright society in a better place (i.e. being able to license) then one who had never been a member at all (who could not, on the Defendants' interpretation, license its own work).",,,,,,,
,,,,"38. Mr. Khambata has referred to the first Proviso to Section 33(1) which recognizes right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The only embargo in such a case is that the owner can grant a license consistent with its obligation qua such registered society. He submitted that what flows from the first proviso to Section 33 is that if as a member of a copyright society an owner can license his own works, 6[1963] 1 WLR 929 varsha 30 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works.",,,,,,,
,,,,occurring in the second proviso can be done only through a registered copyright society.,,,,,,,
,,,,"48. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Madras High Court has in the said decision misconstrued the judgment of this Court in the case of Leopold (supra) and completely misapplied the ratio contained therein. The Madras High Court failed to appreciate that in Leopold (supra), Novex was merely an agent acting on behalf of undisclosed principle (which this Court held was prohibited by Section 33). The Madras High Court has conflated the first and the second proviso to Section 33(1) and applied its interpretation of the second proviso which deals with the authors of the underlying works to the first proviso which deals with assignees/ owners of the entire sound recording.",,,,,,,
,,,,56. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance on the relevant definitions under the Copyright Act namely Section 2(d) which defines Author; Section 2(f) which defines Cinematograph film;,,,,,,,
,,,,"Section 2(ff) which defines Communication to the public; Section 2(j) which defines Exclusive licence; Section 2(uu) which defines Producer; Section 2(xx) which defines sound recording; Section 2(y) which defines work and Section 2(ffd) which defines Copyright society. He has also referred to relevant provisions of the Act which includes Sections 13, 14, 17, 18 ,19, 30 and 33.",,,,,,,
,,,,"58. He has further referred to Section 61 of the Act which provides Owner of copyright to be party to the proceeding. He has submitted that in the present case, the infringement by failure to obtain license by the various Defendants is not only in relation to works of which the Plaintiff/PPL is an exclusive licensee but also in respect of works of which it is itself an varsha 39 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner. Thus and for that reason, Section 61(1) would not apply.",,,,,,,
,,,,"60. Mr. Kadam has submitted that upon reading of the aforementioned provisions of the Act, when an owner is monetizing copyright in any work, the owner is doing so for gain or for profit. Regardless of the scale at which such activity resulting in monetization of copyright takes place, it is a commercial or a business activity as it is being done for gain. Any restriction or curtailment of exercise of ownership rights whether by self- exploitation; assignment; license, depending upon scale or motive/manner of exercise or regularity of exercise of such ownership rights would be reading into the Act facets or nuances relating to the primary right of ownership of a copyright, which the Act does not in its language provide for at all.",,,,,,,
,,,,"61. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance upon provisions of the Bern Convention (1896), to which India is a signatory and particularly Article 2 (6), which provides that the protection of works mentioned in this Article shall shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title. Article 5 (1), which provides varsha 40 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc that Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention. Further, under Article 5(2) it is provided that, the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Further Article 9, which is Right of Reproduction, provides that Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. It shall be a matter for the legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.",,,,,,,
,,,,"63. Mr. Kadam, has supported the submissions of Mr. Kambata as to the interpretation of Chapter VII of the Act brought by the 1994 as varsha 41 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc well as 2012 Amendments, by which the second proviso to Section 33(1) was added. He has submitted that the embargo or prohibition on a person or association of persons commencing or carrying on the business of issuing or granting licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists other than by registering such association of persons as a copyright society [Section 33(1) r/w Section 33(3)] has no application to the issuing or granting of licenses in respect of any work by an owner or by an exclusive licensee who by the terms of the exclusive license is entitled to issue further licenses in respect of the work. This interpretation is supported by the provisions of the Act pertaining to ownership analysed. It is also in consonance with the first proviso to Section 33(1). This proviso clarifies that an owner of copyright shall in his individual capacity, continue to have the right to grant licenses in respect of his own works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,64. Mr. Kadam has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Chapter VII or the relevant rules appearing in Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013 that mandates or forces owners who may in a given case own copyright in a large repertoire of sound recordings to become members of a registered copyright society. He has also placed reliance in this context on Section 34(1)(b) of the Act.,,,,,,,
,,,,65. Mr. Kadam has further submitted that the expression in his individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33 has nothing to do with whether the owner of copyright in a sound recording is granting licenses on a small or large scale so as to constitute such activity as a business. The expression 'capacity' when used in the varsha 42 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc context of a particular status applies where a person enjoys two statuses simultaneously. He has supported this interpretation placed by Mr. Khambata on the first proviso to Section 33 (1) in this context.,,,,,,,
,,,,"66. Mr. Kadam has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"" (supra) has overlooked Section 30 which only speaks of the owner's rights to license and does not talk about any capacity or does not talk about whether the activity is done at an individual level or as a business. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has completely lost sight of the phrase individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33(1), applies in the context of that proviso where the owner of a copyright in a work becomes a member of a Registered Copyright Society for that category of works. This subjectivity of 'individual capacity' transcending into the realm of business is a notion introduced by the judgment and brings about a whole world of uncertainty and ambiguity in the application of the provisions of the Act in paragraph 55. Further, the Madras High Court has concluded that the entity like the plaintiff therein which is involved in the business of issuing licenses falls within the net of the second proviso of Section 33 (1). There is no reasoning as to how the granting of licenses in respect of sound recordings which is not covered by the second proviso of Section 33(1) would take the activity of the Plaintiff within that second proviso.",,,,,,,
,,,,"69. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that since there is no ambiguity in the language of the section, the first rule of statutory interpretation, i.e., of literal interpretation, would demand that the word ""persons"" be given its natural grammatical meaning without any artificial limitations or restrictions.",,,,,,,
,,,,"70. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) prohibits ""any person or association of persons"" from carrying on the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"" without registration as a copyright society. PPL and Novex as aforementioned are covered by Section 33(1) as they are clearly ""persons"" as well as carry on a commercial activity that qualifies as ""business"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"71. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 30 and Section 33(1) operate in separate fields and do not conflict which each other. While Section 30 deals with the general right of an owner to grant a license, Section 33(1) regulates the business of licensing. The law is plain and clear - an owner has the right to issue a license. When his licensing activity enters the realm of ""business"", he is subject to statutory regulation under Chapter VII and must carry on his activities either by seeking registration as a copyright society or by doing it through a registered copyright society. Assuming without admitting there is a conflict, even then Section 33(1) is a special provision and must prevail over the general one. Moreover, the object of copyright law and legislative intent behind Chapter VII is to balance the rights of owners and public interest by varsha 45 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc protecting the rights of users. This would mean owners too are covered by Section 33(1).",,,,,,,
,,,,"72. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not efface or make Section 30 redundant. An owner's right to monetise his copyright through licensing is not taken away at all, it is merely regulated by Section 33(1). Such regulation is perfectly permissible when done by way of statute. In fact, Section 34(3) expressly preserves the right of licensing available under Section 30.",,,,,,,
,,,,"73. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not come to the aid of PPL and Novex because (I) it applies only to members of a Copyright Society; (ii) Assuming the First Proviso applies to non members, even then PPL and Novex are not covered as they do not issue licenses in their ""individual capacity"" or in respect of their ""own works"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"75. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) has no relevance to the present matter. It was brought in by way of amendment in 2012 to correspond to the changes made to Section 18 to protect owners of underlying works. It does not impact Section 33(1), which has been on the statute books since 1994.",,,,,,,
,,,,"76. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Division Bench of this Court in PPL vs. Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.10, disposed off the appeals against a set of ad-interim orders by clarifying that the Defendant may raise ""appropriate contentions including raising the issue of maintainability of the Suits at the instance of the present Plaintiff.""

Plaintiff's advocate in respect of the alleged infringement at page no. 76 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023.",,,,,,,
,,,,78. Mr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that all the ad-interim orders obtained by PPL and Novex in the matters under consideration were limited to directing the Defendants to deposit the license fees in court if they wanted to play the sound recordings or directing the Defendants to take a license from PPL and Novex on a without prejudice basis. Neither did PPL/Novex seek nor did the Court grant them an injunction simplicitor.,,,,,,,
,,,,"79. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument of PPL and Novex runs contrary to the well-settled principle of ex turpi causa non oritur actio or ex dolo malo non oritur actio i.e., a Plaintiff cannot find his cause of action on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law. This principle finds its modern origins in the classic passage of Lord Mansfield C.J. in the 1775 case of Holman vs. Johnson: He has submitted that this passage has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court and High Courts in several cases where the plaintiff's cause of action emanated out of an illegal act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"80. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Narayanamma & Anr. Vs. Govindappa & Ors"".11 has recently reviewed the entire law on ex turpi causa, including Lord Mansfield's seminal passage, and reiterated that if the plaintiff's cause of action 11 [(2019) 19 SCC 42] varsha 48 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc is based on an illegality, it will not grant any relief to the plaintiff, even if the defendant is guilty.",,,,,,,
,,,,"81. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the decision relied upon by PPL and Novex namely the English Supreme Court's decision in ""Patel v Mirza""12 to counter the above does little to assist the Plaintiffs. The said decision actually supports the Defendants' case as it makes clear that ex turpi causa is indeed a valid defence and that courts must examine the underlying purpose of the prohibition and the public policy involved.",,,,,,,
,,,,"82. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Plaintiffs reliance on Gurumukh Singh v Amar Singh [(1991) 3 SCC 79] is also misplaced. The said case dealt with an allegation that the object of the contract was harmful to public policy. There was no contravention of any law involved. In the instant case, however, the Plaintiff's actions are in direct contravention of Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act. As per the law laid by the Supreme Court, it would be impermissible to grant relief to such a plaintiff.",,,,,,,
,,,,"85. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that similar is the case with Novex namely that they carrying on business of issuing / granting licenses. This is apparent from Clauses 1, 4 and 11 of the Memorandum of Association of Novex which makes it clear that the varsha 50 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc main object of Novex is to carry on business of granting licenses. Further, Novex's Annual Report for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 which clearly shows that Novex's principal activity is granting public performance licenses. Further, Novex's website while referring to public performance rights states ""Novex is engaged in the business of giving public performance rights in sound recordings"".

Dr. Tulzapurkar has thereafter, referred to the definition of ""copyright business"" in Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 namely ""business of issuing or granting licence in respect of any class of works in which copyright or any other right conferred by the Act subsists, and includes the functions referred to in sub-section (3) of section 34"". He has submitted that the legislature has consciously chosen to define this term widely and has not excluded the business of licensing carried out by owners.",,,,,,,

Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon ""S Mohan Lal v R Kondiah 20"" and ""P K Kesavan Nair v C K Babu Naidu 21"" to contend that the word ""business"" should be interpreted as per context. However, reference to these cases does not assist PPL and Novex in any manner. There is no justifiable reason given by PPL and Novex to discard the definition of 'business' in the Copyright Rules namely Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013. Further, PPL and Novex have not denied that they indeed carry on business. Their own documents as aforesaid clearly show that PPL and Novex are in the business of licensing.",,,,,,,
,,,,89. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have based their argument on an incorrect assumption that an assignment from the original owner takes them out of the regulatory ambit of 15 [AIR 1953 Mad 343] 16 [(1981) 2 SCC 693] 17 [(1999) 4 SCC 630] 18 [AIR 1965 SC 531] 19 [AIR 1967 SC 1066] 20 [(1979) 2 SCC 616] 21 [1953 SCC OnLine Mad 368] varsha 52 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Chapter VII of the Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules.,,,,,,,
,,,,"91. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is nothing to suggest that this ""contract"" or ""agreement"" referred to in Section 34 and Rule 54 excludes an agreement of assignment. The trigger for regulation is the nature of the activity, i.e., business of licensing, and not the mode of acquisition of the right to carry on such business.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"92. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no conflict between Section 30 and Section 33(1). Alternatively, assuming without conceding there is any conflict, even then Section 33(1) would prevail over Section 30. Section 30 is a general provision that deals with an owner's general right to license his copyright. Section 33, on the other hand, is part of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act, which is a special provision and self-contained chapter that elaborately governs the business of granting and issuing licenses. Moreover, the present Section 33 is a latter provision that was brought in by way of an amendment in 1994. Thus, the legislature had notice of Section 30 when it enacted Section 33(1).

,,,,"93. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is well settled law that the general law must yield to the special law. The Supreme Court in a catena of cases has reiterated this well settled Latin maxim ""generalia specialibus non derogant"". In ""Commercial Tax Officer, Rajasthan vs. Binani Cements Ltd. & Anr."" 22, the Supreme Court exhaustively reviewed the judicial precedents on the subject and noted that this principle is applicable not only amongst two statutes but also finds utility in resolving a conflict between a general and specific provision of the same statute. Further, it is also an accepted principle of interpretation that in case of conflict between two provisions of the same statute, the latter provision will prevail over the former. See K.M. Nanavati vs The State of Bombay 23 and In Re: W. G. Ambekar24. He has further submitted that both above principles are squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and would mandate that Section 33(1) must prevail over Section 30.

,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"94. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is now well accepted that copyright law is not designed for protecting the interest of owners alone. It is intended to balance the rights of the owners with the rights of end users. He has placed reliance upon Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where this principle finds its origins. This is also noted by P. Narayanan in Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs 4th Edition where Article 27 is reproduced. Further, ""Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright"" 25 22 [(2014) 8 SCC 319] 23 [AIR 1961 SC 112] 24 [MANU/MH/0148/1952] 25 (15th Edition) varsha 54 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc explains the rationale for copyright societies (also known as collecting societies). The author notes that collecting societies benefit rights owners and users alike, and in principle operates for the benefit of the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"95. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that India is not alone in regulating the business of collective administration of copyright. Among common law countries, the UK has adopted the 'Collective Management of Copyright (EU Directive) Regulations 2016.' Singapore too has an entire chapter on the subject in Part 9 of its Copyright Act, 2021. Thus, given the strong public interest involved in the collective administration of copyrights, governmental regulation of such business is commonplace across jurisdictions.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"97. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. vs. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"". 27 wherein the Supreme Court has noted that the provisions of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act serve the dual objective of having copyright societies, i.e., to maintain a balance between the protection of owners' rights and interest of the public to have access to the works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"98. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the expansive words of Section 33(1), i.e., ""no person or association of persons shall commence or carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses""

clearly underline the intention of the legislature that business of 26 [(1984) 2 SCC 183] 27 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 56 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc issuing licenses can only be undertaken by a registered copyright society. These words are required to be construed in the context of its use in the Copyright Act and Rules which require that: (i) such business can be carried on only by a registered copyright society; (ii) such society is regulated by the Government; and (iii) there is only one society for one category of work. Thus, allowing PPL to carry on the business of licensing without registration would result in escaping the intended regulation and would be contrary to the scheme and object of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"99. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that if the Plaintiff's argument is accepted and an assignee/owner is permitted to carry on the business of issuing licenses without registration, then Section 33 itself would be rendered redundant and nugatory. This would be contrary to the clear intention of the legislature to regulate the business of licensing, even if the business is carried out by an assignee/owner. Since only an owner (which term includes an assignee) can issue licenses, it is quite obvious that the intent of Section 33(1) was to regulate owners of copyright who can potentially carry on the business of licensing. Thus, there is no logical basis in the Plaintiffs' argument that Section 33(1) applies to persons other than owners. He has submitted that the law intends that there must be a single copyright society for one class of work to ensure a single window for end-users.

",,,,,,,
,,,,"102. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Chapter VII of the Copyright Act requires that the business of licensing be carried on in a particular manner. The Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to circumvent the entire regulatory regime and carry on the business of licensing in a manner other than what is prescribed by law. This would go against the well accepted rule laid down in ""Taylor vs Taylor Taylor"" 33 that if the law requires something to be done in a particular manner, it must be done only in that manner or not at all. He has referred to the decision of the ""Nazir Ahmad vs. The King- Emperor"" 34 and State of ""Uttar Pradesh vs. Singhara Singh"" 35, which follows the Taylor Rule.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"103. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the principles of construction propounded by PPL and Novex are misconceived and not applicable to instant case. He has submitted that the decisions relied upon by them in support of ""harmonious construction"" would 32 [(2001) 7 SCC 358] 33 [(1875) Vol.1Ch.D 426] 34 [1936 LXIII Indian Appeals 372] 35 [(1964) 4 SCR 485] varsha 59 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc require the court to read down Section 33(1) such that ""owners"" are excluded from the word ""persons"". This is contrary to the plain language used in Section 33(1) of the Act. Further, harmonious construction applies only if there is an ambiguity in the language of the statute and cannot be used if the language is clear. In the present case, the language of Section 33(1) is plain and unambiguous. Hence, it would be impermissible to ignore the rule of literal interpretation and apply the rule of ""harmonious construction""

instead.
104. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not take away the general rights of owners to license their works. On the contrary, it retains and preserves that right but only regulates the manner in which the business of licensing is to be carried on. Thus, all that Section 33(1) requires is that if an owner wishes to carry on the business of licensing, he must do it in the legally mandated manner, i.e., through a registered copyright society.
105. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon the decisions in ""Union of India vs. Dileep Kumar Singh""36 to contend that the court must give precedence to the leading provision over the subordinate provision. However, this case too is inapplicable in the present situation. PPL and Novex have been unable to explain how Section 30 is a leading provision and Section 33 is a subordinate provision. On the contrary, the two operate in separate fields altogether.",,,,,,,

In the instant case, there is no ambiguity in the language of Section 33(1). There is no absurdity or unintended consequence by adhering to the plain meaning of Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"107. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that constant refrain of PPL and Novex was that giving literal interpretation to Section 33(1) would lead to ""effacement"" of Section 30 and take away the right of an owner to monetise his copyright is completely incorrect.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"108. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33 does not take away an owner's right to license for commercial purposes. All that Section 33 postulates is that the business of licensing should be carried out in a regulated manner by registration under the Copyright Act. If an owner wishes to carry on business, he has to either be registered as a copyright society himself or must carry on the activity through a copyright society. Quite contrary to the Plaintiffs' submission, Section 33(1) would be effaced if the Plaintiffs' submissions are accepted. Since only an owner can issue licenses, exclusion of an owner from its purview would render Section 33(1) completely meaningless and redundant.

,,,,"iii) Person grants licenses in respect of his ""own works""; iv) the grant is ""consistent with his obligations as a member of the registered society"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"110. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Dwarka Prasad vs. Dwarkadas Saraf"" 37 wherein it is held that a proviso does not travel beyond the main provision. Further, in ""Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited vs. Tarun Pal Singh and Ors"" 38 the Supreme Court went on to explain that a proviso cannot be interpreted as stating a general rule. He has submitted that there is nothing exceptional in the language or scheme of Section 33(1) or the first proviso to suggest that the proviso warrants a deviation from the general rule of interpretation. It cannot therefore be construed as creating an independent right in favour of the Plaintiff beyond the main enacting section.
",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"112. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that copyright societies are ""agencies"" or administrators of rights does not take that case any further. The decision of the Supreme Court's in ""Entertainment Network and Delhi High Court's decision in Lizard Lounge"" (Supra) relied upon by PPL and Novex in this context deal with the question whether business of licensing can be carried out by an owner without registration. Further, Section 33 requires a particular activity, i.e., business of licensing, to be done only by regulated entity/through a regulated entity.
",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"113. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that the authorization granted to a copyright society can be withdrawn by an owner under Section 34(1)(b) would suggest that it is not mandatory for an owner to carry on business only 39 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 63 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc through a society ought to be rejected. All that Section 34(1)(b) says is that an owner is not perpetually bound to be a member of a copyright society and the section enables him to withdraw from a collective management system should he choose to. This is a voluntary act. Once he withdraws, he is in the same position as any other person who is not a member of a copyright society. He can exercise all rights under Section 14 and also issue a license under Section 30 in an individual capacity. But he cannot carry on the business of licensing. If he wishes to recommence the business of licensing, he has to once again join a registered copyright society.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"114. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument canvassed by PPL and Novex was that Section 31 provides for compulsory licensing. Thus, there is no need to regulate owners who carry on the business of licensing by requiring them to register as copyright societies is wholly fallacious and an incorrect reading of Section 31. Compulsory licensing is a completely different concept from regulation of the business of licensing carried on by copyright societies. He has submitted that Section 31 (1) (a) does not allow a user to challenge a Tarriff Scheme, whereas under Section 33 A this is allowed to a user. Further under Section 31, compulsory license can only be granted to a person whom the board/court finds ""qualified"" to receive a license. There is no such restriction under Section 33A. A decision for compulsory licensing under Section 31 creates a right in rem only in favour of the complainant/prospective licensee. On the other hand, an appeal under Section 33A results in modification of the Tariff Scheme for the public at large. Merely varsha 64 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc because the Copyright Act provides two remedies for two different scenarios, it cannot mean that one of the remedies available in law should be given a complete go-by to.

Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the main section 33(1) and the First Proviso have been in the statute since the 1994 varsha 65 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Amendments. The Second Proviso was brought in only in 2012. This is relevant because the 2012 Amendment Act also amended Section 18(1) and added provisos therein which prohibited authors of underlying works from assigning or waiving the right to receive royalties except to their legal heirs or copyright societies. Thus, it was necessary to make corresponding clarificatory changes to Section 33(1).

He has submitted that the Madras High Court extensively considered all issues relating to Section 33 including the arguments raised by the Plaintiffs in the instant matter. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has correctly holds that Section 33 distinguishes between granting licenses in an individual capacity and carrying on the business of licensing. The Court holds that ""once the grant of license moves from the owner in his individual capacity and transcends into the realm of a business ""

Section 33(1) applies. On this basis, the Court concluded that since Novex was statutorily barred from issuing licenses, the very substratum for the relief sought by Novex must crumble like a pack of cards.",,,,,,,

Having examined the background leading to the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012, in view of Section 33(1) and its second proviso, the business of granting or issuing licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists, can be undertaken only through a copyright society registered under Section 33(3) of the Act.

Mr. Narula has submitted that the second Proviso to Section 33(1) and proviso to Section 33 (3A), being the consequence and effect of the amendments to Section 17, 18 and 19 read with Section 30A, provides that the business of issuing or granting licence (being collection and distribution) of sound recording or cinematograph film, which comprises of the non- assignable and non-waivable rights in literary and musical work ""shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under this Act"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"130. Mr. Shenoy has submitted that Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act provides that no person or association of persons shall ""commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses"". It is necessary for this Court to give meaning to what is meant by the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"".He has submitted that these words are used by the Legislature to mean the ""Collective Administration of Copyright"". The same is borne out of the varsha 70 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc statement and objects and reasons of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1992 as well as Clause 11 of Notes on Clause. Further, the title/ heading of Chapter VII is ""Copyright Societies"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"132. Having considered the submissions, for determining the issue that arises in the above suits viz. whether the plaintiff is entitled to seek reliefs sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act, it would be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act. In the present case, that PPL and Novex have been partially assigned the copyright under the Sound Recording Agreements i.e. to communicate the sound recordings to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"133. Section 14 of the Act defines a copyright to mean the exclusive right to reproduce a literary, dramatic or musical work in any material form including storing by electronic means; to make copies of such a work; to perform it in public and in the case of a sound recording it includes the right to sell or give on commercial rentals or to communicate the sound recording to the public. Further, 'Owner' of Copyright is provided in Chapter IV of the Act. As submitted by Mr. Khambata, Ownership of copyright can be acquired in 4 broad ways including through an assignment under Sections 18 & 19 of the Act which is relevant in the present case. These confer varsha 71 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc full and absolute ownership on the author/owner/assignee, as the case may be.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"134. Further Section 18(2) of the Act provides as under :

""where the assignee of a copyright becomes entitled to any right comprised in the copyright, the assignee as respects the rights so assigned, and the assignor as respects the rights not assigned, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner of copyright and the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"135. Whereas Section 18 (1) of the Act specifically recognizes the owner's right to assign his copyright either wholly or partially, to any person. This is a substantive right which has been provided to an owner under the Act and can be exercised without restrictions except as provided in the section.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"136. Thus, in my view a partial assignment created as in the present case in favour of PPL and Novex i.e. to communicate sound recording to the public, to the extent of the right so created, the assignee is an 'owner' of the copyright in the work.

varsha                                                                      72 of 87




 Varsha                                                  COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc",,,,,,,
,,,,"137. PPL and Novex as assignees/owners of copyright license their work under section 30 of the Act. This Section falls under Chapter VI of the Act and reads as under:

""30. Licences by owners of copyright.:-The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:
Provided that in the case of a licence relating to copyright in any future work, the licence shall take effect only when the work comes into existence.
Explanation.-- Where a person to whom a licence relating to copyright in any future work is granted under this section dies before the work comes into existence, his legal representatives shall, in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the licence, be entitled to the benefit of the licence"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"138. Thus, Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright who may be an assignee, the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers a ""duly authorized agent"" of the varsha 73 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner, to grant license. Thus, it follows that PPL and Novex as owners/assignees have the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license which would include the interest of communicating the sound recordings to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"139. Now turning to the scope and object of the 1994 Amendment which added Chapter VII and in particular sections 33 to 36 in the Act. Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses reads as follows:
",,,,,,,
,,,,"""This clause seeks to substitute new provisions for Chapter VII to make provision for copyright societies in respect of any kind of right (and not merely ""performer's rights"") and to make adequate general provision for the registration and management of such societies in the interests both of authors and of other copyright owners for whom it would be impractical or uneconomical to licence the use of their work individually to all users,...""
",,,,,,,
,,,,"140. Thus, from a reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses Sections 33 to 36 have been introduced as part of Chapter VII for promoting the collective administration of rights through copyright societies, both for the benefit of the owner as well as the general public. These societies, on an ""authorization"" from the varsha 74 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. A copyright Society fundamentally operates to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"141. In my view, by its very nature, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) as an authorized agent and (ii) as an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. It is necessary to note that under section 34 of the Act and in particular Section 34 (1) (b) it is provided that an owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This also shows that an author or other owner/assignee does not have to carry on the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights under Section 30 of the Act to grant licenses as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author/owner withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"142. Thus it is clear that the 1994 Amendment which introduced these provisions was brought in to protect and facilitate varsha 75 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the exercise of ""owner's"" rights, not to restrict or diminish them in any way.

,,,,"143. The other relevant provision namely Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent. Section 35(1) of the Act provides that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ..."". Thus, both Sections 34 and 35 draw a clear distinction between the author/ owner of the right on the one hand and the administrator of that right on the other (i.e. the copyright society).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"144. The decision relied upon by Mr. Khambata on behalf of Novex namely ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"" (Supra) is apposite. The Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. The Supreme Court holds that as per the Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Paragraph 66 of the said decision reads as under:

""66. ...It may, however, be of some importance to note that Chapter VII deals with Copyright society, the concept whereof was incorporated in the Act so varsha 76 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property by a widespread dispersal in a regulated manner.

25.....The Copyright Society is an agent appointed under the agreement by the owner of the Copyright and specific powers have been conferred on the agent to institute legal proceedings. However, this does not denuding the author of its own individual rights"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"147. The function of a Copyright Society has been highlighted by Copinger at Page 1540 which has been relied upon by Mr. Khambata for Novex, wherein copyright society is referred to as a collecting society. Collecting societies provide a service to enable rights owners to enforce and administer certain of their copyrights effectively and cheaply, and secondly to provide a service to users by facilitating access to copyright works and making it possible for users to comply with their obligations under the law to obtain licences for the use of copyright works. Advantages of collecting societies has also been mentioned. Collecting societies are practically, economically and legally both viable and essential: Practically, because copyright owners cannot be in an indefinite number of places at the same time exercising individual rights. Further, ""collecting administration bodies provide the best available mechanism for licensing and administering copyrights and is to be encouraged wherever individual licensing is not practicable. They represent the best means of protecting the rights owners' interests"", enabling copyright owners to license and monitor the use of their works, to collect and distribute together and to bring varsha 78 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc actions for infringement. At the same time, they facilitate access to copyright protected works for the consumer and minimize the number of persons with whom users must negotiate licensing contracts.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"148. I am of the considered view that Section 33 (1) of the Act cannot curtail the power of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license under Section 30 of the Act. This provision has not at all being denuded by the 1994 Amendment, which has brought in Chapter VII in the Act
",,,,,,,
,,,,"149. I do not find any merit in the interpretation placed by the Defendant that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an ""owner"" of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. If such interpretation is accepted, Section 33(1) of the Act would take way the power of owner and / or the right of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license. This would emasculate right of the owner under Section 30. This was not contemplated by the Parliament by way of the 1994 Amendment Act. In my view, Chapter VII which deals with copyright society is operating in a different field than that of Chapter VI which is the source for granting of licenses by the owner of copyright.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"150. It is a settled rule of Interpretation that two apparently conflicting provisions operating in two different fields should be reconciled by restricting each to its own object varsha 79 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc or subject. This has been expressly held by Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay"" 41. I find much merit in the interpretation placed by counsel on behalf of PPL and Novex that the prohibition as contemplated under Section 33(1) is on carrying on business of licensing by a person or association of persons in its own name for works in which ""others"". hold copyright. This has also held by this Court in Leopold Cafe and Stores and Anr. (supra). Thus in other words carry on ""business' of granting licenses can be authorised to an agent such as a copyright society under Section 30 read with Section 18, 19 and 34 of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"151. Further, the heading of Section 33 is ""Registration of copyright society"" and which could only mean that where a copyright society wants to carry on the business of issuing licenses on behalf of ""others"", then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33. This is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling in Chapter VI of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"152. The Interpretation placed on ""business"" in Section 33(1) of the Act by learned counsel on behalf of the Defendants by referring to Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 which defines 'Copyright Business' is in my view misconceived. This definition is in wide terms although it also references sub- section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. However, if 41 AIR 1961 SC 112 (Para 77(1)) (Sr. No. 41/ Page 737, Volume IV of Defendant's Compilation).

,,,,"the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Sections 30 and 33 of the Act. The definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules and it cannot be applied to interpret Section 33(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). Further, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"153. Much has been said by the counsel for the Defendants that Section 33 of the Act is a later provision and prevails over Section 30 of the Act. I find in ""K.M. Nanavati' (supra), the Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. Further, the Supreme Court has held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. I find that from the two provision viz. Sections 30 and 33(1) of the Act, Section 30 is the leading provision which is the source of power i.e. licensing rights conferred rights upon an owner . Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.

Although, there have been arguments on the First Proviso and Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act as well as reference to the legislation of 2012 Act as well as parliamentary debates and Speeches on this legislation, these provisos are inapplicable to the present case. The Second Proviso is confined to authors of underlying works which requires protection and thus inapplicable to the present case which concerns the owner of sound recordings. The Second Proviso to Section 33(1) in fact militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded on behalf of the Defendants. By amending section 33(1) in 2012 i.e. by adding the second proviso it would show that the Parliament itself did not contemplate that Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works. Thus, the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under the Act. Hence, it cannot be accepted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act is clarificatory.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"155. The Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications vs DXC Technology Pvt Ltd"". (supra) has in my view overlooked Section 30 of the Act where the owner has a right to grant any interest in the copyright by way of license. The Madras High Court has applied the second proviso of section 33(1) of the Act to the right to communicate the sound recordings to the public, although such right does not fall within that proviso. The second varsha 82 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso as mentioned is confined to underlying works. Further, the Madras High Court has held that Novex is not entitled to issue licenses which according to the Court falls into the second proviso after considering legislative history and speeches in parliament. However, no reason has been provided as to how the licenses in respect of sound recording is covered by the second proviso to section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"156. Thus in my view the Madras High Court has not considered Section 33(1) in light of other provisions of the Act namely Section 30 read with Section 18 and 30 of the Act which enables the Plaintiff- Novex as owner to grant licenses to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"157. In my considered view carrying on business of granting licences cannot be excluded from section 30 of the Act, particularly when such granting of licenses is by the owner of the copyright. The word ""business"" would include the grant of Licenses. If the interpretation of the Defendants on business is to be accepted then in that case 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy. Thus, this interpretation of the Defendant cannot be accepted.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"158. The decisions on business relied upon by the Counsel on both sides only support the above view.

,,,,"159. The first proviso of Section 33(1) of the Act only recognizes the right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The first proviso has nothing to do with granting of Licenses by an owner of copyright under section 30 of the Act. If a member of the copyright society can grant license surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works. Thus, the first proviso to Section 33(1) cannot in any manner prevent a non member from exercising his rights under Section 30 of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"160. It appears from the argument of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that a distinction has been drawn between the granting of individual licenses by the owner and the carrying on of business of granting licenses by the owner which makes section 33 (1) applicable. I find no merit in this argument, particularly in view of aforementioned findings that Section 30 of the Act confers the power on the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license which in my view would encompass an owner carrying on business of granting licenses in respect of works in which he has copyright. Thus, there would be no fetter on the owners rights under Section 30 of the Act by Section 33(1) of the Act which falls under a separate chapter. Thus, in my view it is not necessary for PPL and Novex as owners/assignees of copyright to be registered as copyright societies for carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works.

,,,,"161. Merely because PPL was at one time registered as a copyright society will make no difference to the above findings as PPL is granting Licenses as an owner and thus entitled under Section 30 of the Act to grant its interest in the copyright by license. Further, it will not make any difference that Novex is carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works as there is no restriction placed on an owner to grant any interest in the copyright by License. Thus, in my view the power under Section 30 to grant license by an owner has in no manner been denuded by section 33(1) of the Act. Accordingly, PPL and Novex as owners of copyright in respect of their works are entitled to file the present suits and seek reliefs sought for therein.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"162. The above findings will also apply to those Suits where PPL and /or Novex are exclusive Licensees as Section 54 of the copyright Act, provides that an 'owner of copyright' includes an 'exclusive licensee'.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"163. I further find no merit in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that the cause of action in the above suits is on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law as the plaintiffs have been generally assigned the business of granting licenses which activity they seek protection without having themselves registered as copyright society and thus violative of the statutory protection in Section 33(1) of the Act.

This is in view of my finding that PPL and Novex have the power as owners to grant interest in the copyright by license under section 30 of the Act irrespective of whether they are carrying on the business of granting licenses or not. Further, there is no bar under section 33(1) of the Act from an owner carrying on the business of licensing, or collecting license fees. Accordingly, I do not find that the Assignment Agreements and/or Exclusive License Agreements are illegal as contended on behalf of Defendants.

3,"Piramal Enterprises Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra And Another on 11 June, 2024","3. The facts as discerned from the petition are:- During the financial year 2010-11, the petitioner entered into a Business Transfer Agreement dated 21 May, 2010 (for short ""BTA"") with one M/s. Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (for short ""Abbott Healthcare"") to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Abbott Healthcare ""the Base Domestic Formulations Business"" (comprised of Healthcare Solutions business and the mass market branded formulation - (Truecare business) on a ""going concern""

5. On 08 September, 2010, the petitioner and Abbott Healthcare entered into an amendment agreement to the BTA, to also include remaining tangible and intangible assets, in terms of which the consideration payable for the acquisition of the said business as a going concern, was increased to US $ 3.80 billion.","1. This petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India challenges an order dated 31 March, 2021 passed by respondent no.2-Joint Commissioner of State Tax (for short, ""reviewing authority"") under Section 25 of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002 (for short ""MVAT Act"") exercising the review jurisdiction. By the impugned order, respondent no.2 has reviewed the order dated 16 March, 2015 passed by the assessing officer finalizing the petitioner's assessment for the financial year 2010-11. Consequent to the impugned order, a notice of demand dated 31 March, 2021 is issued to the petitioner under Section 32 of the MVAT Act, which is also assailed by the petitioner.

Thus, the primary question which arises for consideration in the present proceedings is as to whether the respondents in the facts of the case could tax sale of the petitioner's 'Base Domestic Formulation Business' as a ""going concern"" (slump sale) under the provisions of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002.","11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc resulting in patent violation of the fundamental rights and the constitutional rights enshrined under Article 14, 19(1)(g), 21, 265 and 300A of the Constitution.",,B. 1st Affidavit in reply on behalf of the Respondents:-,"12. The respondents have opposed the writ petition by filing a reply affidavit of Dr. David Alvares - respondent No.2. At the outset, the affidavit contends that this petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is not maintainable as there is no warrant for this Court to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is contended that the impugned order can be effectively challenged before the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal under Section 26 of MVAT Act, 2002, hence, a writ petition filed without exhausting alternative remedy ought not to be entertained. It is contended that there is mandate of pre-deposit of 10% of the tax before filing an appeal as per the provisions of sub-section (6A) of Section 26 of the MVAT and to avoid such pre-deposit, the petitioner has filed this petition.","14. On merits of the petitioner's case, it is contended that initiation of an action for review of the assessment order dated 16 March, 2015 by issuing show cause notice and the order passed on the review proceedings and the consequent demand notice, are well within the jurisdiction of respondent No. 2 under the provisions of Section 25 of the MVAT Act, hence, it is not correct for the petitioner to contend that the proceedings are without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or they are on wrongful assumption of jurisdiction. Also the allegations of the petitioner that the impugned order is in violation of the principles of natural justice, is stated to be too casual for the reason that right from the issuance of show cause notice till the impugned order was passed, the petitioner was heard through its representative on a number of occasions. Hence, as sufficient opportunity of a hearing was afforded not only to the representative of the petitioner but also to the representative of Abbott Healthcare (transferee) whose advocate could not physically attend due to the spread of COVID in Delhi, he was heard on an audio/teleconference as arranged when Abbott's submissions were recorded. Also, sufficient

,,"6. The petitioner was subjected to assessment for financial year 2010- 11 under Section 23 of the MVAT Act. An assessment order dated 16 March, 2015 was passed, inter alia holding that the transaction contemplated and effected under the BTA, was a transfer of a business ""on a going concern basis"" and hence, not exigible to the Value Added Tax (for short, ""VAT"") under the MVAT Act. This, according to the petitioner, was after taking into account all relevant aspects concerning the BTA. Accordingly, the consideration received towards the 'sale of the business' was excluded from the turnover of the petitioner, for the purpose of levy of VAT under the MVAT Act.
7. After about two years, the petitioner received a show cause notice dated 06 April, 2017 issued under Section 25 of the MVAT Act read with Rule 30 of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Rules, 2005 (for short, ""MVAT Rules"") in Form 309 proposing to review the assessment (supra) for the financial year 2010-11, by holding that the business transfer was incorrectly allowed as a slump sale. Such notice was solely on the ground that the allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purposes was provided in Schedule 3.3 of the BTA, which included consideration for tangible, intangible, movable and immovable assets, which was required to be considered as ""turnover"" of the petitioner's sales for the said period and","by the petitioner of certain intellectual property rights namely trade name, logo, goodwill etc. for a fixed period of time in the BTA. Respondent no.2 held that the 'right to use' or 'lease' is covered under the definition of sale under the MVAT Act, hence, the said transaction of transfer of rights for a fixed period falls within the scope of the definition of ""sale"" under the MVAT Act. Accordingly, the Joint Commissioner/respondent No.2 by the impugned order confirmed the notice issued under Section 25 of the MVAT Act and raised the impugned demand notice dated 31 March, 2021.","11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc MVAT Act. In such context, it is contended that under the definition of ""business"" as defined by Section 2(4) of the MVAT Act and the Explanation (iv) thereto provides that any transaction in relation to the commencement or closure of business shall be deemed to be transaction comprised in business. It is stated that the transfer of business in question is covered under the definition of ""business"" and liable to tax. That slump sales are not being exempted from tax under the GST regime, it is also liable to be taxed under the MVAT, however, liable to tax at NIL rate which means it is taxable. Illustratively, it is contended that the Tamil Nadu VAT Act provides for sale of business undertaking under Section 2(41) as not liable to be included in turnover, but for such specific exclusion, it was liable to sales tax.",,13. It is next contended that even otherwise the impugned order of respondent No.2 is purely based on the facts of the case and the applicability of relevant law. It is hence contended that this Court ought,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc petitioner to buttress its contention, are on the peculiar facts of individual cases and the principles as laid down in such decisions are not applicable to the peculiar facts of the present case. Further the allegations of the petitioner that there is non application of mind by respondent No.2 in passing the impugned order, merely because some parts of the impugned order are similar to the portions of the show cause notice dated 15 October 2015 issued by the Jurisdictional Service Tax Authorities, is not correct, as the impugned order is independently passed considering all facts and law involved in the present case. It is hence contended that there is no violation of principles of natural justice. The petition is thus not maintainable.","iii. On the petitioner's contention that the impugned order is beyond the scope of show cause notice, it is submitted that a plain reading of the show cause notice would demonstrate that the scope of the show cause notice was wide, which was inter alia on the incorrect allowing of deduction of value of slump sales and non- consideration of the value of the assets as separately shown under Schedule 3.3 of the BTA. The show cause notice also specifically mentions other allied issues which widened the issue of show cause notice in the widest possible manner. Also the petitioner had ample",,"(vi) all other movable assets, properties, resources, facilities, utilities and services, including machinery, equipment, systems, implements, apparatus, instruments, mechanical and spare parts, fixtures, trade fixtures, tools, tooling, dyes, production supplies, storage tanks, pipes and fittings, utilities, utensils, furniture and fixtures, office equipment, communication facilities and capital work-in-progress, training materials and equipment, supplies, owned and leased motor vehicles, laptops, mobile phones and personal digital assistants used by the Transferred Employees, and other tangible property of any kind;

According to the petitioner, the review was premised only on the basis of the itemized break-up of the total consideration being provided by the parties purely for the stamp duty purposes and as permissible in law, hence, VAT could not be levied on the assets transferred, as a part of the business transfer.
8. The petitioner responded to such notice by its reply dated 05 May, 2017 contesting the revenue's case in the review notice. In its reply, the petitioner inter alia contended that the itemized value of assets does not affect the nature of the transaction as a ""transfer of business"". The petitioner also contended that transfer under BTA was in the nature of ""transfer of business"" as a going concern would not attract tax under the provisions of the MVAT Act, hence, it was not taxable. There were several other contentions raised on facts and law.

On such notice, a personal hearing was held by respondent no.2 on 22 August, 2017 and 22 March, 2021 when the authorized representative of the petitioner made extensive submissions, on the basis of the case as made out in the petitioner's reply.

It is submitted that Schedule 3.3 of the agreement is formulated for a limited purpose, solely for the purposes of payment of stamp duty which is a requirement of law, and which does not in any way reflect that the agreement between the petitioner and the purchaser of the business was to effect an itemized sale. Even otherwise, there is no bar on itemized sale if such itemized sale is for transfer of business as a going concern. Lump-sum consideration as a pre-condition itself would not attract the provisions of the MVAT Act, hence, no reference can be made to the aspect of Schedule 3.3 to derogate the agreement in question.

It is next contended that the purport of the show cause notice was also clear to the effect that respondent No.2 intended to review the assessment order dated 16 March 2015, and the reasons for such review in substance was to the effect that there was no sale of business of domestic and generic formulation that could be allowed as a deduction. It is submitted that the reasons as furnished for reviewing the assessment order if read as a whole, indicate that there was a sale of individual assets and for such reason, a deduction of sale of business was not warranted. It is next contended that the revenue's case as narrated in the show cause notice dated 6 April 2017 does not restrict the reviewing authority to pass an order on facts elicited during the proceedings so as to restrict scope of the review proceedings, especially when ample opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner right from 2017 to 2021.","(xi) Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted that the impugned order and the impugned demand notice are patently bad in law as the same are beyond the scope of the show cause notice, more particularly when the impugned order was sought to be passed in exercise of the review powers under the provisions of Section 25 of the MVAT Act. It is submitted that the review power is to be exercised conditional upon the Commissioner serving on the dealer a notice in the prescribed form namely in 'Form 309' as prescribed in Rule 30 of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Rules, 2005, as Section 25(1) of the MVAT Act mandates that the notice shall be as prescribed under the rules and in Form 309. It is submitted that in the present case, the notice under Section 25 read with Rule 30 was issued to the petitioner being notice dated 06 April, 2017 which had set out the ""gist of the order proposed to be passed"". This notice recorded that if the petitioner wished to prefer any objection against such order as proposed to be passed, the petitioner could attend a hearing before the relevant officer. It is hence submitted that on a cumulative reading of Section

It can thus be seen from the gist of the order proposed to be passed in the review proceedings, that the reviewing authority, on a perusal of the BTA in general and more particularly Schedule 3.3, noticed that the allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purpose of the items as contained in Schedule 3.3 of the BTA included various types of assets. He stated that the petitioner (dealer) had bifurcated the consideration of the tangible immovable assets, trademark and associate rights, brandwise breakup, rights under exclusive distribution agreement, trademark licences, business transfer agreement and non-stampable assets. Accordingly, the show cause notice recorded that there was reason to believe, that the claim of sale of business of domestic and generic formulation to Abbott Healthcare as slump sale, was incorrectly granted by the assessing authority by not bringing to tax, such turnover of sales as

,,"38. The petitioner replied to the review notice received under Section 25 of the MVAT Act by its detailed letter dated 05 May, 2017 addressed to the reviewing authority. In the reply, the petitioner contended that it was not liable to pay any tax on any of the reasons/ allegations as set out in the review notice. It was stated that such reasons were clearly based on erroneous appreciation of the factual scenario and incorrect interpretation of the legal provisions. It was stated that the allegation of understatement of liability on the ground that assets transferred under the slump sale are liable to be taxed as sale of goods, for the reason that Schedule 3.3 of the BTA contained separate valuation of assets, was wholly unfounded and made on surmises and fallacious presumptions, without appreciating the factual and legal position qua the nuances of the slump sale. The following primary contentions were raised by the petitioner alongwith supporting decisions, in its reply to the show cause notice to contend that sale of business as a going concern was not taxable under the MVAT Act:-

(i) sale of business does not fall within the definition of 'goods';","16. It is next contended that whether a transaction of sale of business as going concern or otherwise, is a question of fact, hence within the permissible parameters of review. The legal decisions, as referred by the

In regard to applicability of service tax, it is contended that the applicability of service tax does not in any manner exclude applicability of VAT. It is contended that it is established that the transaction in question is amenable to VAT, as held in the impugned order. The contention of the petitioner to the effect that the impugned order accepts the transaction to be a Business Transfer is denied, in contending that this would amount to an erroneous interpretation of the impugned order by the petitioner. The petitioner's contention that itemized valuation of the assets as transferred would not be relevant, when the sale of business was","11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc 25 of the MVAT Act with Rule 30 of the MVAT Rules and Form 309, it was explicit that the respondents are required to (i) issue a notice to the affected party and (ii) grant a hearing to the affected party if it has any objections to the proposed order. It is submitted that in the present case, the notice in question forming the basis for review was to the effect that the transaction in question is not a slump sale for the reason that under Schedule 3.3 to the BTA included various assets and allocation of cash consideration for the purpose of stamp duty. The opinion of the department, therefore, was that the petitioner (dealer), had bifurcated the consideration of the different assets and for such reason, although the transaction was not a slump sale, incorrectly the petitioner was granted benefit of a slump sale by the assessing officer. It is for such reason, it was proposed to review the assessment order. On such backdrop, it is submitted that in passing the impugned order dated 31 March, 2021, reviewing the original assessment order, the proposed basis of the review has been completely forsaken and an entirely new basis was adopted. It is submitted that this is clear from the fact that the impugned order proceeds on the basis of some of the intellectual property rights namely corporate name, corporate logo and goodwill","3.

The petitioner was represented at such hearing, as also the representative of Abbott Healthcare appeared by teleconferencing.

In the impugned order, the basic premise on which it was decided to","22. It is next contended that the consideration for transfer of business is lump sum under the guise of 'Business Transfer Agreement', however, certain intellectual properties defined therein, are transferred with several limitations and conditions, some of them for limited period of eight to nine years, namely Corporate Name and Logo. It is, hence, stated that although the BTA and consideration thereof may not be taxable, it does not mean that when there is a separate agreement for transfer of intellectual property rights, the consideration thereof cannot be ascertained from allied documents.

","vii. That there was a clear commercial rationale for allowing temporary / non-exclusive use of the corporate name and corporate

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc logo, to enable successful transition of the business from seller to buyer. The business sold by the seller alongwith the products, were associated with the seller since many years. After transfer of the business, when the buyer was to sell the acquired products in the market, there would be a likelihood of a doubt in the mind of the public in general on the genuineness of the product and its source. Hence, to avoid such situation in the public mind for the products, that too in pharmaceutical space, there was a compelling need for temporary use of the seller corporate name and corporate logo etc. in connection with the transferred business and the nature of business transaction under the BTA can be taken away or be different because of the mere temporary non-exclusive use allowed to achieve the principal objective of the business transfer.

(viii) Such temporary/non-exclusive use does not derogate the agreement or the treatment of transfer of a business.",,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc as a going concern is alleged to be untenable from the interpretation of legal materials and the reading of the document(s) as a whole. It is next contended that the agreement for sale and clauses therein are not consistent with the transaction of sale of business as a going concern for the reason that there are several clauses which provide for exclusion of assets in sale of business transaction, which according to the Revenue, is inconsistent with the petitioner's claim of the sale of business. Although part of sale of assets is coupled with transfer of right to use, the definition of sale in Section 2(24) includes transfer of 'right to use' as a deemed sale. It is next contended that the petitioner was served with show cause notice which clearly indicated that a deduction of sale of business as slump sale was incorrectly granted. It is stated that the case of the Revenue in the show cause notice and the hearing thereon were always on points of entitlement on a deduction as slump sale in which the petitioner participated. It is, therefore, not correct for the petitioner to state that the scope of review in any manner was restricted by the show cause notice when in fact the petitioner was specifically confronted with the nature of the transactions at the time of hearing, which had led to the impugned conclusion based on facts of the case and written submissions. It is, therefore, submitted that the petition deserves to be dismissed.
","31. It is next submitted that the impugned order and the impugned notice of demand are bad in law on the ground that there is no application of mind by the respondents for many reasons. In this context, it is submitted that the jurisdictional service tax authorities under the Finance Act, 1994 had also raised on the petitioner a service tax demand vide a notice dated 15 October, 2015, on identical issues as raised in the impugned order. The respondent authority had taken recourse to such order passed by the service authorities to the effect that the allegations from the service tax demand notice were verbatim copied as clearly seen from the impugned order. In this regard, a reference is made to paragraphs 13 to 26 and 30 to 31 of the impugned order, which when examined against paragraph 4, 5.1 to 5.4, 6.1 and 10 of the service tax order / demand notice would evidence that the impugned order has merely copied and pasted the findings and reasons from service tax proceedings. A comparative table to that effect is also placed on record to show the copying of the extract from the service tax demand notice. It is, therefore, submitted that the reviewing authority has not applied its mind","47. Before we proceed to examine the above questions, it would be appropriate to note in some detail the relevant contents of the BTA, so as to appreciate the basic nature of the transaction between the parties.

It is thus submitted that the petitioner was never put to a notice of the actual basis as found in the impugned order, (ii) the petitioner never had an opportunity to meet such basis, (iii) the petitioner never had an opportunity of a hearing on such issues which were in fact, alien to the notice.

It is contended that the initiation of review of the assessment order by issuing show cause notice and thereafter passing of the impugned order in the review proceedings and issuance of the consequent demand notice, are well within the jurisdiction of respondent no.2 as per the provisions of Section 25 of the MVAT Act. It is hence not correct for the petitioner to contend that the proceedings are without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or of wrongful assumption of jurisdiction. It is further contended that the petitioner's contention that the impugned order is in violation of principles of natural justice is too casual and self serving as right from the show cause notice till the impugned order was passed, the petitioner was heard on number of occasions.

However, the reviewing authority has taken the value of these items for the purposes of exigibility to tax under the MVAT Act as Rs.17,598 Crores, which sum includes goodwill, brands transferred and software.

On further scrutiny of the records, the Assessing Officer noted that out of the consideration of Rs.19,500/- for the transfer of its Ooty branch, a sum of Rs.18,929.71 representing the sale value of the closing stock held at Ooty branch was wrongly exempted from payment of tax, hence the assessee was not eligible for exemption under the Sales Tax Rules. Accordingly, notice was issued to the assessee calling for its objections to the proposed revision of assessment. The assessee responded to the notice by contending that the business at Ooty branch as a whole was sold and that the branch business was also to be considered as a business as defined under Section 2(d) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959, and that the sale value of the stock held was eligible for the exemption from payment of tax under Rule 6(d) of the Rules. The Assessing Officer did not accept this objection, as he was of the view that only the business sold as a whole was exempted from tax. He accordingly considered a sum of Rs.18,929.71 as the sale value of the stock and added it to a turnover for the year and assessed sales tax accordingly. The Assessee's appeal against the said order did not succeed. On a further appeal, before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal it was found that the entire business including furniture, fittings etc., had been transferred. The tribunal was held that the turnover in question was liable to be exempted.","11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc (internal page 28 thereof), the respondents have agreed to the factum, that the present case is one of a transfer of business.

In this context, it is submitted that the BTA as a whole is required to be read and interpreted to know the nature of actual transaction and the interpretation of an agreement cannot depend solely on the basis of the words and language used but on the basis of intention of the parties.

It is not the fact that the valuation of the individual assets for stamp duty purpose was a factor leading to levy of tax but enumeration of several assets clearly shown in the BTA as also exclusion of certain assets, was a reason to levy tax. It is a settled principle of law that levy of tax and measure of tax are different subjects. Further Section 2.2 spells out exclusion of several assets which shows the intention of the parties to transfer the assets alongwith the business of pharmaceutical products. There is transfer of certain liabilities and exclusion of specific liabilities. Also as seen from Section 2.3, 2.5 and Section 4 specific intellectual properties are separately transferred for limited period of 8 years or for 9 months. It is further submitted that there is a separate agreement titled ""Trade Mark Agreement and Registered Users Agreement"" which although not annexed to the petition, and if the business transfer on lock, stock and barrel was intended, in such event there was no need for separate agreement or enumeration of assets.

F. Analysis and Conclusion:-

35. As seen from the foregoing paragraphs, the case revolves around the Writ Petition No.12297 of 2021 (Aurangabad Bench) decided on 16/02/2022 Writ Petition No.202 of 2020 decided on 15/06/2022

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc BTA dated 21 May, 2010 entered by the petitioner to sell its domestic pharmaceutical business to Abbott Healthcare. Under the BTA, the petitioner had desired to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Abbott Healthcare the said business which comprised of the 'transferred assets' as a ""going concern"" on a 'slump sale basis' as defined under Section 2 (42C) of the Income Tax Act, on terms and conditions as set out under the BTA. It is not in dispute that under the MVAT Act an assessment was undertaken for the financial year 2010-11 being the period during which the BTA was executed between the petitioner and Abbott Healthcare. An assessment order dated 16 March 2015 came to be passed under Section 23 of the MVAT Act, under which the assessing officer held that the BTA is a case of transfer of 'entire business' on a 'slump sale basis', along with all assets and liabilities and therefore, is not exigible to tax under the MVAT Act. The relevant observations of the assessing officer are required to be noted which read thus:-

""In response to notice in form 301 Shri. Girish Guna, Manager, attended from time to time and produced books of accounts and related details maintained under SAP system.
Dealer is a manufacturer in medicines, plant at Mahad, dist. Raigad, Vitamins and animal feed at Thane plant, lab eqpts and reagents at Panvel New Mumbai plant and cosmetics mainly lacto calamine manufactured by third party.

Sales of scrap and Assets are identified.

During this period there is transaction of entire sale of business of domestic formulation/generic formulation business to M/s. Abbott Healthcare and Labourites on slump sale basis along with all assets and liabilities.
Dealer has submitted a detailed letter in this regard I have gone through his submissions and conclude that is a slump sale and does not fall under the definition of sale hence not Taxed. ......""",,"24. It is next contended that the unique feature of the BTA is that all assets or all liabilities are not transferred. The transfer of business is qualified and limited to 'transferred assets' and 'transferred liabilities' along with 'excluded assets' and 'excluded liabilities'. It is stated that the excluded assets and excluded liabilities are substantial in nature. The following statement in the affidavit needs to be noted:-

""It is a case of slump sale not liable to tax according to the Petitioner, suffice it to say that the authority has not at all levied tax on the value of consideration for business transfer but levied tax on part of the assets such as intellectual property rights along with other intangible assets separately agreed to be transferred with restrictions and limitations.""","5. Any appeal against the order must be presented to the Joint Commissioner of State Tax (Appeal-4)-6 GST Office, BKC Bandra, Mumbai - within the time and in the manner laid down in section 26 of Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002.""","56. No doubt that incorporeal rights are considered to be goods, which ought not to be in dispute [see Vikas Sales Corporation Vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (supra) and Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors. 25], however, the question is whether considering the complexion and the nature of the agreement between the parties as contained under the BTA, the reviewing authority could have at all adopted such approach. As noted above, the contention of the petitioner is that such approach of the reviewing authority not only amounts to misreading of the BTA, but also not recognizing the correct position in law. We find ourselves in agreement with such contentions of 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 5274

","36. Such assessment order continued to operate for a period of two years. Thereafter the respondents invoked the provisions of Section 25 of the MVAT Act and initiated proceedings to review the assessment order dated 16 March, 2015, by issuing a notice under Section 25 read with Rule 30 of the MVAT Rules inter alia setting out the gist of the order proposed to be passed against the petitioner. As such notice has a significant bearing on the proceedings and as to what was called upon to be answered/replied by the petitioner, it may be necessary to extract the ""Gist of the order proposed to be passed"", which reads thus:-

      ""              Gist of the order proposed to be passed

While scrutinizing assessment record for F.Y. 2010-11 assessing authority has allowed transaction of sale of business of domestic and generic formulation to M/s. Abott Healthcare as slump sale along with assets and liabilities. However after perusal of business transfer agreement in general and Schedule 3.3 in particular it is noticed that the allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purpose includes various types of assets as referred in schedule 3.3 annexed to the agreement.

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc The dealer has bifurcated the consideration for Tangible immovable assets, Trademark & Associate Rights, brandwise breakup, rights under exclusive distribution agreement, Trademark Licences, Business Transfer Agreement and nonstampable assets. Thus I have reason to believe that the claim of sale of business of domestic and generic formulation to M/s. Abott Healthcare as slump sale is incorrectly granted by assessing authority and such Turnover of sale has not been brought to tax and Liability to tax is understated. Hence I propose to review assessment for F.Y. 2010- 2011 u/s. 25 of MVAT Act, 2002 for the issue raised above and other allied issues as revealed form the business transfer agreement.""

,,,"46. Considering the impugned order and the rival contentions as urged on behalf of the parties in the facts and circumstances of the case, the following issues would arise for our consideration:-

i. Whether the slump sale under the BTA would amount to sale of goods within the purview of the MVAT Act so as to be taxed, as held by the impugned order ?
ii. Whether the Reviewing Authority was within its jurisdiction under Section 25 of the MVAT Act to vivisect the BTA ?
iii. Whether the impugned order would stand vitiated or rendered illegal when tested on the provisions of law and the grounds as raised by the petitioner ?","-------------------------

(ii) sale of business is distinguishable from 'sale in the course of business';

(iii) the petitioner (noticee) does not qualify as a 'dealer' as defined under Section 2(8) of the MVAT Act qua the sale under the BTA;

(iv) there is a clear distinction between 'transfer of business' vis-a-vis 'closure of business';",,"26. It is next contended that the BTA is a camouflage document for transfer of assets under the guise of the transfer of entire business undertaking as although retention of some of the assets or not taking over some of the liabilities does not make the nature of transaction being transfer of business as a going concern. It is stated that what is significant is that substantial part of assets and liabilities are not transferred, and therefore such transfer cannot be treated as transfer of undertaking.","(m) the Distribution and Promotion Agreement entered into and effective as of March 19, 2010 by and amont, on the one hand, MSD Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., Merck Sharp & Dohme Asia Pacific Services Pte. Ltd, and on the other hand, Seller; and","11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc proposed to be passed"", which was on the fundamental premise that from Schedule 3.3 of the BTA, it was noticed by the reviewing authority that allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purposes for various types of assets and more particularly, bifurcation of the consideration of tangible immovable assets, trade mark and associate rights, brandwise break up rights under exclusive distribution agreement, trade mark licence, would amount to turnover of sale which has not been brought to tax, and that the liability to tax was understated in the context of slump sale, which is alongwith the assets and liabilities. It is thus clear that the show cause notice setting out gist of the order on one hand, recognizes that the sale under BTA was 'slump sale' and on the other hand, the reviewing authority by the impugned order has regarded these items as contained in Schedule 3.3, as 'sale of goods' to be considered as turnover of sales of petitioner. Thus the opinion of the department that the petitioner had bifurcated the consideration of its assets sought to be transferred as per the value as indicated in schedule 3.3 was forsaken in passing the impugned order when the reviewing authority has observed that the intellectual property rights being not permanently transferred and being transferred for a limited period, would amount to sale of goods.

The petitioner was represented at such hearing, as also the representative of Abbott Healthcare appeared by teleconferencing. The petitioner also submitted a synopsis of its submissions, reiterating its contentions. The reviewing authority accordingly proceeded to pass the impugned order dated 31 March, 2021. In the impugned order, the basic premise on which it was decided to

",,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc the reviewing authority, as put and intimated to the petitioner in the show cause notice, however, what has actually being done by the reviewing authority, is different from such version in the show cause notice. The petitioner therefore would be correct in its contentions that such approach of the reviewing authority has resulted in a defective hearing being granted to the petitioner resulting in breach of the principles of natural justice. This also for the reason that it is well settled that the principles of natural justice would postulate that the revenue sets out the entire case point wise to the petitioner and invite the petitioner's version on each of such aspects. It cannot be a situation that a decision is rendered by a quasi-judicial authority on the issues which were not posed/confronted in a precise, clear and unambiguous manner to the noticee in the perspective, such issues were intended to be comprehended by the authority. In our opinion, failure to follow such basic tenets would certainly result in a prejudice to the parties resulting in breach of principles of natural justice, thereby vitiating the order being passed. The principles of law in this context are well settled in catena of decisions of the Supreme Court, as also relied upon on behalf of the petitioner. However, we would not burden the judgment in discussing such well settled position in law.

In regard to the aforesaid issues, considering the clauses of the BTA and more particularly section 2.1 (purchase and sale), section 2.2 (excluded assets), section 2.5 (intellectual property) and its sub-clauses, the reviewing authority held that these sections of the BTA clearly established and confirmed, that the right to use ""seller's corporate name""

and ""seller's corporate logo"" are transferred to the purchaser (Abbott Healthcare) temporarily for a fixed period, further considering the Registered User Agreement dated 08 September, 2010 entered between the parties in relation to the transfer of IPR rights to Abbott Healthcare.
In respect of the registered trademark of the petitioner, it was observed that the right to use the trademarks and trade name of the petitioner and
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc their affiliates have been transferred to Abbott Healthcare and their affiliates temporarily for a fixed period, without any limitation on the seller or their affiliates to use the trademarks. Similar observations were made in respect of the 'trade name' and 'logo' of the petitioner of having been transferred temporarily for a fixed period. It was observed that the intellectual property rights transferred under the BTA included the goodwill of seller and its affiliates solely with respect to the business and the transferred assets ('the goodwill') as mentioned under Section 2.1(xxii) of the BTA. It was also observed that under Section 10.6(n) of the BTA, Abbott Healthcare was described as 'purchaser of the goodwill', hence, as set out in the BTA, the intangible properties transferred by the seller (petitioner) to the buyer (Abbott Healthcare), included the petitioner's goodwill. For such reasons as along with the other rights namely permitting the use of the petitioner's corporate name and logo, the petitioner's goodwill having been transferred to Abbott Healthcare temporarily for a fixed period, it amounted to sale of goods so as to be included in the sales turnover of the petitioner for the financial year in question.",,"29. Mr. Rafiq Dada, learned senior counsel for the petitioner in support of the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, has made the following submissions:-

ii. For the levy of MVAT under the charging provision namely Section 3 read with Section 6, the jurisdictional pre-conditions are",,"61. Be that as it may, what was necessary for the reviewing authority, was not to deviate itself from the well accepted norms and approach of a holistic reading of such commercial document to ascertain as to what was the real intention of the parties in entering the BTA, and what is the cumulative and commercial effect of different clauses of the agreement when tested on the anvil of the provisions of the MVAT Act, to ascertain whether schedule 3.3 read with the other clauses of the agreement would amount to sale of goods, so as to fall within the definition of turnover of sales under the MVAT Act. On a holistic reading of the agreement, it was clear that what was intended between the parties was a lock, stock and barrel transfer of the pharmaceutical business on slump sale basis to Abbott Healthcare.

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc affiliates, as contained in Section 10.6 of the BTA, it was observed that the scrutiny of the BTA revealed that the agreement inter alia included non- competition and non-solicitation clause for a period of 8 years from the date of closure of agreement, it is not a case of sale of business as a slump sale. Further considering that the petitioner had maintained that the transaction involved under the BTA was a 'transfer of business' and not a sale of goods and that the term 'transfer of business' was not defined under the MVAT Act, therefore, the principles/criteria defining a transfer of business would be required to be culled out from various decisions which are dealt with the subject. Accordingly, considering the decisions of IBP Company Limited vs. Asstt. Commissioner Commercial Taxes 24 State of Tamilnadu vs. TMT Drill Pvt. Ltd. as also the decision of the Kerala High Court in Zacharia vs. State of Kerala , the reviewing authority observed that the petitioner/dealer although transferred its entire business to the other party (Abbott Healthcare) and even if the BTA is a slump sale under the Income Tax Act, however, in case of intellectual property rights (trade name, logo, goodwill etc.) by transferring the assets for a limited period and by keeping the ownership rights with the petitioner, hence although the petitioner has not sold the goods per se, but had allowed the 118 STC 33

In this regard, the relevant observations as made in the impugned order are required to be noted, which read thus:-

"" In the present case under consideration, it is observed that the dealer has no doubt transferred his entire business to the other party and may be he has qualified for the purpose of slump sale under the IT Act, but, in case of intellectual property rights (trade name, logo, goodwill etc.,) by transferring the assets for a limited period and by keeping the ownership rights with self, has not sold the goods per se but has allowed the purchasing party the right to use the goods for a fixed period of time as entered in the BTA.

or ""in the course of business"". Hence, applying the settled law, a transaction whereby the entire business is transferred ""lock, stock and barrel"", under which the seller is completely divested of the business and the buyer is completely vested with the business would constitute a ""transfer of business"" and would not be liable to VAT, as such a transaction is not considered as having been undertaken ""in the course of business"".",,"70. We are also in agreement with the contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner when the petitioner urges that the impugned review order is bad in law for the reason that there is non-application of mind by the reviewing authority in passing such order on another aspect. In this regard we find that when the reviewing authority intended to confine itself to the value assigned to the intangible assets as contained in Schedule 3.3 read with Section 3.3 and Section 2.5, the same has been borrowed / copied
",,"(b) The tax benefits and concessions available to an undertaking of a company shall continue to be available to the undertaking on transfer of the same while concessions and benefits that are available to the transferor company as an entity and not to the undertaking of the company proposed to be transferred, should remain with the transferor-company.
",
,,,,"42. Thus, the reviewing authority considering the clauses in regard to the intellectual property rights (trade name, logo, goodwill, etc.), has held that the transaction was a sale within the meaning of Section 2(24) of the MVAT Act. In this regard, the following observations were made:-

      ""      Here, we can observe that
      (i)     There is sale - as the contingency of allowing 'the right to
use' is covered under the definition of sale under the MVAT Act as per S.2(24) quoted as above.

(ii) There is 'goods' - as the intellectual property rights for which ownership rights are retained by the seller, is covered as 'goods' as per Schedule Entry C-39 of the MVAT act, which reads, ""Goods of intangible or incorporeal nature as may be notified,

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc from time to time, by the State Government in the Official Gazette."" Also, with the intention to take back the proprietary rights after 9 months and 8 years, probably the dealer wants to continue in the business. (and has continued as PEL). Ideally, if the transfer of a business meets the conditions to be a Transfer of On Going Concern (TOGC), the seller may be required to deregister for VAT if it is no longer making any taxable supplies.,

(iii) There is sale 'in the course of business', as the proprietary rights intended to be kept as such, the transaction of sale of 'right to use of goods' is 'in connection with' or 'incidental to' or 'in the course of' business.

Hence, all the essential conditions as pointed out by the dealer in his submissions are met.

Whereas it appears that the provisions of Income Tax act, providing privileges to an assessee, not to declare the value of individual assets transferred in case of slump sale, is applicable only for observing other different provisions of the said Act only. The said taxation Act or any other such Act does not debar an assessee to follow the provisions of other taxation Acts. Accordingly, the Income Tax Act and the MVAT Act, 2002, being two different and independent taxation Acts, have separately their own provisions and they do not have any provision to allow an assessee to ignore or disobey the provisions of the other Acts. It appears that the assessee has simply attempted to take shelter of the said provision of the Income Tax Act, declaring the subject- transaction a slump sale and thereby not declaring the individual value of the properties transferred, to escape from payment of MVAT. In view of all the above deliberations, I have no doubt in concluding that the transaction of transfer of rights for a fixed period falls within the scope of the definition of ""sale"" under the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002.

From the scrutiny of the BTA, it was also observed that the said BTA has allocation of the cash consideration of USD 3.80 billion, received by M/s PHL form M/s AHPL, for the sale of their Domestic Pharmaceutical Business, as reproduced below. ...""",,"iii. In the present case, the petitioner has transferred the pharmaceutical business to Abbott Healthcare and as a consequence thereto, thereafter, has not conducted such business, post the date of the transfer. Since 2010, the buyer alone is conducting such business. Hence, applying the settled principles of law, there can be no levy of VAT in respect of the transaction, subject matter of the agreement. In supporting such submission, reliance is placed on (i) Deputy Commissioner (C.T.), Coimbatore vs. K. Behanan Thomas 1,",,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc from the service tax demand notice in ad-verbatim manner.

In this context we may also observe that the parameters of proceedings for levy of service tax, as it then stood under the provisions of the Finance Act,1994, could not have been borrowed to be made applicable for levy of VAT under the MVAT Act. We hence, wonder as to how the Reviewing Authority could verbatim borrow / copy the contents of the notice issued by the Service Tax Authority.

Such position was also disclosed in the bank accounts of the petitioner as also of the purchaser of the business and with the income tax authorities. It is thus submitted that in the facts of the present case as per the relevant statutory provisions and as per the settled principles of law, the jurisdictional facts for levy of VAT were not satisfied, as there could be no levy of VAT, considering the nature of the transaction under 1989(41) ELT 368 (S.C.) 2015(8) TMT 749 (S.C.) 1998 (8) SCC 1 2009 (8) SCC 209.",,"45. In the case on hand, another important feature is that the petitioner which is a partnership firm, sought to transfer the entire business as a going concern under a business transfer agreement to a private limited company of which the partners of the petitioner were the shareholders. In consideration of the transfer of the business as a whole, the partners of the petitioner were allotted equity shares and preferential shares in the company. Therefore, to treat the same as a sale of goods merely on the ground that all the assets of business are individually mentioned in the Schedule together with their value, is completely contrary to the Statutory prescription. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed on an assumed jurisdiction, where none exists. The impugned order has been passed on a complete misunderstanding of the purport of the decision of the Full Bench in Coromandal Fertilisers Limited, the effect of Section 2(6) read with Section 2(28) and Rule 36. It is not the case of the respondent that the petitioner had claimed Input Tax Credit under Section 13(5)(b) so as to treat the case as not one of transfer of business as a whole.""

The slump sale ""to be understood as defined under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act"". The parties have specifically defined the business and all its material ingredients including the tangible and intangible assets as extracted by us hereinabove. Article 2 of the BTA under Section 2.1 specifically records the agreement between the parties that the petitioner/seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser (Abbott Healthcare) free and clear of all encumbrances and the purchaser shall purchase and acquire the business comprised of transferred assets as defined under the agreement as transferred assets. We have also noted that Section 2.5 of the BTA extensively dealt with the intellectual property and for a specified period. Further under article 3 of the BTA, the parties have provided for the purchase price being a consideration of Indian Rupee equivalent of 3 Billion 720 Million Dollars (USD 3,720,000,000) (being the cash consideration) payable in accordance with Section 10.7 of the BTA. Further under Section 3.3 of the BTA, the parties have provided for allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purposes and in such context, have provided for allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purposes in Schedule 3.3 which we have extracted hereinabove. Thus, the

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc intention of the parties in attributing allocation of the amounts is purely in the context of what has been agreed to in schedule 3.3 i.e. for stamp duty purposes only, as itself seen from the title of schedule 3.3. Applying the settled principles of law, the BTA being a commercial document, would be required to be understood in the manner and intention the parties have desired and as reflected and indicative of in the various clauses (sections). It would be thus difficult for any authority or even for the Court to attribute a different intention not only to the clauses of the BTA, but also in regard to the lump sum consideration in regard to the transfer of the said business as agreed between the parties. Thus, necessarily section 3.3 would be required to be read along with schedule 3.3 of the BTA and attributed a meaning as conferred by the parties, failing which it would amount to misreading of the BTA and/or its purport.

It is next submitted that the impugned order is barred by limitation as prescribed under the provisions of Section 25 (2)(b) of the MVAT Act, which mandates that no order under this provision be passed after the expiry of 5 years from the end of the year in which the order passed by the subordinate officer has been served on the dealer. It is submitted that in the present case, the relevant assessment order passed by the subordinate officer is dated 16 March, 2015, which was served on the petitioner on 01 April, 2015. It is hence submitted that the impugned order in terms of the said provision ought to have been passed and served on or before 31 March, 2021. It is submitted that the impugned order purports to have been passed on 31 March, 2021 and as the same was served on the petitioner on 08 April, 2021, hence, as per the settled principles of law, it would be required to be considered to have been passed on the day on which it is served on the adverse party.

It is submitted that the petitioner also has not averred that the issue of levy of tax on transfer of IPR was not confronted and explained to the petitioner. In such circumstances it cannot be countenanced that the impugned order is beyond the show cause notice. It is next contended that it may be true that the impugned order ought to be within the gist of the show cause notice however while assuming and not admitting, it is submitted that the circumstances warrant that the petitioner meets the department's case of re-hearing of the matter which can be by way of fresh/de novo hearing on all the aspects. This would not warrant absolute quashing of the impugned order but requires that the petitioner asserts its stand at a de novo hearing. In such context, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai Vs. Amitabh Bachchan 20. The submission referring to this judgment is to the effect that Section 25 merely mandates issuance of notice as per Rule 30 in Form 309 and does not require or provide confining the review authority to the terms of the notice and in foreclosing consideration of any other issue or question of fact. For such reason the impugned (2016)11 SCC 748

As Section 25 would take into its ambit the turnover of sales which is not brought to tax, it would be required to note that Section 2(33) which defines 'turnover of sales' defines it to mean the aggregate of the amounts of sale price received and receivable by a dealer in respect of any sale of goods made during a given period as ordained by Section 2(33). Further as turnover of sales is defined under Section 2(33) to include sale of goods, the definition of the terms namely ""business"", ""goods"" and ""sales"" as defined under Sections 2(4), 2(12) and 2(24) of the MVAT Act are also relevant and are required to be considered. Section 2(12) which

It is also relevant to note that Section 2(4) has independently defined 'business' to include any service, any trade, commerce or manufacture, any adventure or concern in the nature of service, trade, commerce or manufacture. Section 2(24) has defined ""sale"" to mean a sale of goods made within the State.",,"ix. It is submitted that the case of the petitioner that the transaction of transfer is not in the course of business, it is submitted that since as per Section 2(4) and Explanation (iv) below it, any transaction in connection with the commencement or closure of business shall be deemed to be a transaction comprised in a business.

It also cannot be said that 'business' per se would amount to goods hence, it is difficult to conceive that sale of business can be categorized as any sale of goods so as to fall within the meaning of 'turnover of sale' as defined under Section 2(33). There cannot be turnover of sale of businesses.",,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc xi. On the petitioner's contention that the impugned order is passed without application of mind, it is submitted that the impugned order is a well reasoned order and has considered all aspects of case, hence, it cannot be said that the impugned order is passed without application of mind. It is also not a non-speaking order considering all submissions of the petitioner. xii. In regard to the petitioner's contention that the impugned order levies VAT contrary to Section 3 of the MVAT Act, is also urged to be not correct. In this context, it is submitted that as per Section 3 of the MVAT Act, the dealer is liable to pay tax till his business certificate or licence is cancelled. For this reason, as on the date of the BTA the certificate of the petitioner was not cancelled, it would be required to be attributed to the BTA, to tax the BTA, considering the provisions of Section 2(24), 2(25), 2(29) and 2(33) of the MVAT which which defines ""Sale"", ""Sale Price"", ""Tax"" and ""Turnover of sales"" respectively.",,,,,
,,,,"55. Having said so, we may observe that the reviewing authority has not disputed the position that what has been undertaken by the petitioner under the BTA is sale of business. However, the Reviewing Authority having examined various clauses of the BTA and purportedly to give effect to item 39 of Schedule 'C', has included the items (intangible assets) as contained in Schedule 3.3 of the BTA namely the heads of intellectual property (trade name, corporate logo, goodwill, etc.) to be goods as defined under Section 2(12) of the MVAT Act, so as to be included within the definition of 'turnover of sales' as defined in clause 2(33).",,"xiii. It is submitted that the petitioner's transaction fulfills all such requirements/criteria hence the BTA was liable to tax. xiv. It is next submitted that the petitioner's contention that the show cause notice itself was vague is not tenable, as it was clear that
",,,,,
,,,,"57. The first and foremost reason is to the effect that in doing so, the reviewing authority has adopted a pick and choose approach in dissecting the agreement and more particularly Section 3.3 read with Schedule 3.3 to give a different meaning to such part of the BTA dealing in regard to the intellectual property rights, so as to construe the same to be not part of a slump sale underlying the agreement. In other words, it can be said that the reviewing authority has formed an opinion that qua the items as contained in Schedule 3.3 and in relation to the value of these items in terms of money, as indicated therein, the parties have a different intention, namely of not considering these items to form an integral part of the sale of business in its entirety under the BTA. In our clear opinion, this is a fundamental error and a legal perversity on the part of the Reviewing Authority, not only in relation to the overall facts and the clear purport of the agreement between the parties, but also an apparent illegality when tested in law. We say so for the reason that neither the assessing officer nor the reviewing authority exercising the review powers under Section 25 of the MVAT Act would have jurisdiction to read the agreement in a manner which would in fact be contrary to the intention of the parties as discerned from the holistic reading of the BTA. It is not permissible for

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc the authorities to do so and more particularly when the parties are not only clear in regard to the terms and conditions of the BTA, as already implemented and acted upon, that what was meant to be transferred was the business as a whole in its entirety as a slump sale.",,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc the claim of the petitioner of a slump sale was incorrectly accepted and the turnover of sales being not brought to tax by the assessing officer was the issue called upon to be answered by the petitioner. It is submitted that the petitioner has not contended in the reply to the show cause notice that it has not understood the nature of the notice and in fact the petitioner at all material times was aware of such notice, hence, the show cause notice could not have been said to be a vague show cause notice.",,,,,
,,,,"58. In our opinion, the reviewing authority was required to consider the effect of these clauses of the BTA, as persons of commerce would consider, appreciate and understand such clauses in terms of their commercial efficacy, even in applying the provisions of the MVAT Act. This more particularly when the parties in relation to a slump sale were permitted under one of the legislations namely under the Income Tax Act, to attribute values to different tangible assets and intangible assets and for such reason, Schedule 3.3 along with specific clauses in regard to intellectual property came to be incorporated under the BTA. Hence, providing of such values to the intangible assets as objected by the reviewing authority could never have changed the intention of the parties, that qua such items the parties have a different intention and/or were not intending to transfer the business in its entirety as a slump sale, including on such items of tangible and intangible assets.",,"45. On such conspectus, the petitioner is before the Court assailing the impugned review order passed by the respondents under Section 25 of the MVAT Act on the contentions as already noted by us. The primary contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner is to the effect that the impugned order is passed in excess of jurisdiction, as it seeks to artificially vivisect a business transfer which according to the petitioner, is impermissible in law, as also, on the ground that the impugned demand notice is illegal and the same is well beyond the notice and the provisions",,,,,
,,,,"59. Thus, on a reading of the impugned order, it is abundantly clear that while forming an opinion different from what has been formed by the

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc Assessing Officer, such opinion of the reviewing authority has travelled beyond the contours of the BTA. In exercise of the review jurisdiction, the reviewing authority has intended to attribute a different meaning to Section 3.3 read with Schedule 3.3 when he discusses the effect of the said clauses when tested on the touchstone of his jurisdiction under Section 25 of the MVAT Act. The jurisdiction of the reviewing authority was to confine himself to the provisions of Section 25 in undertaking review of the assessment order. He could have re-examined the agreement only in the context of what has been provided by sub-sections (a) and (b) thereof and not otherwise, however, the reviewing authority exercising the review jurisdiction has travelled far beyond such explicit jurisdiction when he vivisects the BTA to take a view to levy tax on the BTA forming an untenable opinion on reading of Schedule 3.3. The review jurisdiction cannot be a jurisdiction under which the reviewing authority would intend to tax something which on a holistic reading of the BTA was per se not taxable under the MVAT Act. Such position would be clear from the following discussion.",,"66. We may observe that the petitioner in fact had furnished an effective explanation in its reply to the show cause notice issued by the reviewing authority when the petitioner contended that sale of business as a going concern, was not taxable under the MVAT Act, and more particularly when the petitioner's business was being sold as a going",,,,,
,,,,"60. The grounds on which the review jurisdiction was to be exercised by the reviewing authority as informed to the petitioner was confined to what was set out in the review notice under the heading ""Gist of the order",,,,,,,
,,,,"62. Insofar as Section 3.3 of the BTA is concerned, it clearly provides for allocation of cash consideration for stamp duty purpose. Section 3.3 reads thus:-

""Section 3.3 Allocation of Cash Consideration for Stamp Duty Purposes.
Following the Effective Date, but prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth the allocation of the Cash Consideration among the Transferred Assets for purposes of calculating the stamp duty payable on the transfer of those Transferred Assets which are subject to stamp duty, which such schedule shall be attached hereto as Schedule 3.3. The Parties shall treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in all filings with Governmental Authorities for all
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc stamp duty purposes consistent with the allocation set forth on Schedule 3.3.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"63. The reviewing authority thereafter has applied Section 2.5 of the BTA pertaining to intellectual property and more particularly, Section 2.5(c) to hold that the petitioner granting a fixed term of eight years to the purchaser as an irrevocable, exclusive and royalty free licence, to use the petitioner's corporate name for the purpose of, inter alia, making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or exporting genuine pharmaceutical products in finished form in India as provided under the said clause would make the BTA liable to be taxed. In this context, it would be imperative to note the provision of Section 2.5 of the BTA to ascertain the effect of the said clause on the transfer of business as intended by the parties, in regard to the use of the intellectual property rights in favour of the purchaser for such limited period. Section 2.5(c) reads thus:

""2.5 Intellectual property:
... .... ...
(c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall grant to Purchaser and its Affiliates for a fixed-term of eight (8) years, an irrevocable, exclusive (even with respect to Seller and its Affiliates) and royalty-free right and license (with the right to grant sublicenses to distributors, agents and wholesalers (but only to the extent necessary to distribute pharmaceutical products on behalf of Purchaser), and to third party manufacturers (but only to the extent necessary to manufacture on behalf of Purchaser)) to use the Seller Corporate Name for purposes of making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or exporting generic pharmaceutical products in finished form in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka; provided, however, that the present

,,,,"64. Thus, the question is also as to whether by providing Section 2.5 read with Section 3.3 and Schedule 3.3 in the BTA, the parties at all intended that the transaction under BTA would take away much less bring about a different intention qua the transfer of business. The parties provided values inter alia to these intangible assets as set out in Schedule 3.3 for the purpose of stamp duty and as recognized under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act, however, this would bring about a different consequence in regard to the transfer of business, and/or that this would in any manner amount to a sale of these intangible assets so as to be regarded and included within the ambit of sale of goods falling within the 'turnover of sales'. We are not shown any bar on itemized sale when such sale is in

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc the context of sale of a business as a going concern. It is not in dispute that the parties had agreed for a lump sum consideration. If that be so, as to how the provisions of the MVAT Act as referred by us hereinabove would get attracted, is not understood. Thus, in our opinion, the answer would be certainly in the negative as seen from the reading of the BTA and the intention of the parties it depicts.",,,,,,,
,,,,"65. In our opinion, Section 2.5 read with Section 3.3 and Schedule 3.3 if is read in the manner as set out in the impugned order, would lead to a patent absurdity, so as to negate the intention of the parties, to have a outright sale of pharmaceutical business in its entirety. Such reading of the BTA would not only be against the intention of the parties as reflected from various clauses of the BTA as also it would amount to do a damage to what was realistically intended by the parties and acted upon. In the facts of the case, such selective vivisection of the agreement was certainly not permissible.",,,,,,,
,,,,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc concern. The petitioner had appropriately stated as to why itemized value of the assets and liabilities set out in Schedule 3.3 would not affect the nature of the transaction which was to transfer the on-going business to Abbott Healthcare. It was clearly stated that the itemized lists of assets and liabilities were provided only for the purpose of computation for the purpose of stamp duty in respect of such transfer and which very well fell within the acceptability of a formed slump sale as permitted under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act (as it stood at the relevant time) read with explanation (2) thereof, the relevant extract of which reads thus:-

""Section 2 (42C) - Slump Sale means the transfer of one or more undertakings as a result of the sale for a lump sum consideration without values being assigned to the individual assets and liabilities in such sales. .........""
Explanation 2 to Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act reads thus:-

""For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the determination of the value of an asset or liability for the sole purpose of payment of stamp duty, registration fees or other similar taxes or fees shall not be regarded as assignment of values to individual assets or liabilities.""",,,,,,,

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc shall not be regarded as assigning of values to individual assets and liabilities. Thus, in the context of such provision, mere assigning of such values could have never affected the slump sale and would not affect the transaction of sale of the petitioner's business as a going concern. If this be the position as to how the reviewing authority could consider the determination of such value to be a sale of goods even applying the provisions of the MVAT Act cannot be understood. It was imperative for the reviewing authority to consider that the intangible assets were integral and inextricable elements in the transfer of business as contemplated by the parties under the BTA, and the same were required to be transitioned on well accepted commercial rationale and the market/commercial norms, so as to achieve a gradual and complete transfer of business as designed by the parties. Thus, the petitioner permitting Abbott Healthcare to assign ""a particular period"" to use the corporate name and logo as a part of the transitional arrangement certainly could not be construed to mean that the business in its entirety was not being transferred by the petitioner. Although such position was explicitly pointed out to the reviewing authority alongwith the relevant decisions in that regard, the reviewing authority has failed to consider the true nature of the transaction under the BTA and that it was a composite transaction in taking the view as

,,,,"68. We may observe that the petitioner, in canvassing the perspective of non-taxability of the BTA under the MVAT Act, as observed by us, had categorically set out the commercial rationale for allowing temporary / non exclusive use of corporate name and logo to enable successful transition of the business from the petitioner to Abbott Healthcare. It was informed to the reviewing authority that the business sold by the petitioner was alongwith the products which were associated with the petitioner since many years and that after the transfer of business, Abbott Healthcare was required to sell the acquired products in the market and such situation ought not to be of any doubt in the minds of public on the genuineness of the products and its source. Hence, to avoid such situation in the public mind qua the products, that too in pharmaceutical sphere, it was explained that there was compelling need for use of seller's corporate name and corporate logo etc. in the transfer of the business under the BTA. Although such explanation was offered, it is seen that there is no discussion whatsoever, in this regard, in the impugned order. This shows

,,,,"69. The aforesaid discussion would lead us to arrive at a conclusion that the jurisdictional facts for the levy of VAT were certainly not satisfied in the review authority passing the impugned order. Thus, the reviewing authority has acted in excess of jurisdiction in exercising its powers under Section 25 of the MVAT Act in vivisecting the BTA. It is also clear to us that as per se slump sale under the BTA would not amount to sale of goods within the meaning of the MVAT Act, the reviewing authority could not have dissected or attempted to reconstruction of the BTA in the manner as done in the impugned order.",,,,,,,

Even considered from the perspective of the Income Tax Act,1961 which under Section 2(42C) defines 'Slump sale', we may observe that such clause defining 'Slump sale' was inserted by the Finance Act,1999 with effect from 1 April 2000 which was explained in Board Circular No.779 dated 14 September 1999. The relevant part of which is extracted in the commentary of the learned authors ""Chaturvedi & Pithisaria"" -

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc Income Tax Law, Eighth Edition needs to be noted which reads thus:

56. Business re-organization-extensive amendments in relation to amalgamation, demerger and slump sale. 56.1 The business and economic environment of the country has thrown up the need for simplification and rationalization of laws relating to business re-organization for rationalization of the production system and better utilization of resources which have become necessary with a view to enabling the Indian industry to restructure itself to become globally competitive. It was in this background that the tax concessions to conversion of firms into companies or proprietary concerns into companies were provided in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, and were widely welcomed.
Following this up, the Finance Act, 1999, has carried out a number of amendments for the entire gamut of business reorganization. These include rationalization of the existing provisions relating to amalgamation of companies, new provisions relating to demerger of companies and sale or transfer of business as a going concern through slump sale. 56.2 Amalgamation in relation to the companies has been defined under the existing provisions of the Income-tax Act to mean the merger of one or more companies with another company or the merger of two or more companies to form one company. There are a number of provisions in the Income-tax Act having bearing on amalgamation. Demerger is relatively a new phenomenon in the Indian corporate sector. A demerger is a reorganization of a company where all the existing assets and liabilities are divided into one or more additional entities leading to resulting companies. While there are no specific provisions under the Companies Act governing demergers, some transactions of this nature do take place through schemes of compromise or arrangement under sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act and these are sanctioned by the High Courts. A slump sale is a form of reorganization where an undertaking or a division is transferred from one person to another for a lump sum consideration without values being assigned to the individual assets and liabilities transferred.

56.3 Extensive amendments in the Income-tax Act have been carried out on the basis of the following broad principles:

(a) The restructuring shall not attract additional liabilities to tax and also not result in the withdrawal of relief and concessions available to the existing unit.
-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc

(b) The tax benefits and concessions available to an undertaking of a company shall continue to be available to the undertaking on transfer of the same while concessions and benefits that are available to the transferor company as an entity and not to the undertaking of the company proposed to be transferred, should remain with the transferor-company.

(c) Tax benefits to such business reorganizations should be limited to the transfer of business as a going concern and not to the transfer of specific assets which would amount to sale of assets and not a business reorganization.

56.4 (vii) A new clause (42C) has been inserted in section 2 of the Income-tax Act to define the expression ""slump sale"". Slump sale shall mean the transfer by way of sale of one or more undertakings for a lump sum consideration without assigning values for individual assets and liabilities. Explanation I to the clause follows the meaning of ""undertaking"" given in clause (19AA) of section 2. Explanation 2 to the clause has clarified that the determination of the value of an asset or a liability for the sole purpose of payment of stamp duty, registration fees or other similar taxes or fees shall not be regarded as assignment of values to individual assets or liabilities. [Clause (h), Section 3] 56.5 These amendments will take effect from 1 st day of April, 2000 and will, accordingly, apply to the assessment year 2000- 01 and subsequent years. [Section 58]'.",,,,,,,

Mugneeram Bangur & Co.26 have observed that after the decision of the Supreme Court in the said case, it was always understood that in the case of sale of a business as going concern, there would not be (1965)57 ITR 299(SC)

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc any liability with reference to the assets comprised therein and that liability for capital gains can be computed by treating the business as a whole and as a single asset distinguishing it from a severable or item-wise sale. It is stated that such principle was observed in the Sales Tax cases, so that no sales tax liability is incurred in sale of business as a whole. It would be profitable to extract the relevant part from the commentary, which reads thus:

""2. Slump sale.-After the decision of the Supreme Court in CIT v Mugneeram Bangur & Co', it was always understood that in the case of sale of a business as a going concern, there can be no liability with reference to any asset comprised therein and that liability for capital gains has to be computed by treating the business as a whole and as a single asset distinguishing it from a severable or item-wise sale. Such a view had been followed in a number of cases ruling out any withdrawal of depreciation under section 41(2), so that the entire surplus was treated as long-term capital gains². Similarly, stock- in-trade, it had been held, cannot also be separately considered, so that what would have been business profits on sale of stock-in-trade has to be construed as part of capital gains. The principle was applied in sales tax cases, so that no sales tax liability, was inferred in such sale of business as a whole. In a slump sale, the seller cannot withdraw any asset from the business sold and the purchaser cannot reject any asset or liability comprised in the business. .... ... .. .""",,,,,,,
,,,,"73. It is thus clearly seen that although parties have set out the value to the assets in Schedule 3.3, applying the aforesaid principles as recognized under the Income Tax Act, the transfer of business in question under the BTA cannot be regarded as any item wise sale but necessarily would be required to be treated as a sale of a business as a going concern, not

,,,,"76. In Deputy Commissioner (C.T.), Coimbatore Vs. K. Behanan Thomas (supra), the Court was concerned with the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, wherein the assessee was finally assessed to tax on a total taxable turnover of Rs. 1,59,291.31 and Rs.1,37,880.50 respectively for the year 1967-68 by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer/Assessing",,,,,,,
,,,,"11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc It is against such decision, the revenue was in a revision before the High Court. It is in such context, the Court examined the revenue's contentions and the principles of law in that regard. The Court examined the definition of turnover and held that the sale in such case was of a running business as a going concern for a consideration of Rs.19,500/-. It was observed that the sale of the stock-in trade for the purpose of closing down the business was different from the sale of the business as a whole as a running concern. It was observed that sale of a business, lock, stock and barrel was not incidental or ancillary to the carrying on of a business so as to be taxable under the Act. The relevant observations can be found in paragraphs 12, 15 & 16 of the report which reads thus:-

""12. The combined effect of the definition of these expressions will show that for a turnover to come within the scope of the Act, it must be the aggregate amount for which the goods are bought or sold, that is, bought, or sold in the course of business, the business having the meaning as defined in section 2(d) of the Act. When a person who is carrying on business sells the entire business or a branch of the business, he sells the same as a running business or a going concern. The sale proceeds of such a transaction cannot be said to constitute turnover as defined in the Act, because the sale proceeds are not proceeds of sale of goods made in the course of business as defined in the Act. The closure of a branch by sale thereof as a running concern to another person, apart from not constituting a sale of goods, cannot also be said to be a transaction in connection with or incidental or ancillary to such trade, commerce, adventure or concern mentioned in section 2(d) (i) of the Act. Consequently, such sale proceeds being totally outside the scope of the Act cannot form part of the turnover as defined in the Act and hence such turnover is not exigible to tax under the provisions of the Act. If so, the question of such sale proceeds being deducted from the total turnover under rule 6(d) of the

-------------------------

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Rules, 1959, will not arise because that rule contemplates determination of the taxable turnover by deducting the items mentioned therein from the total turnover of a dealer. Once it is found that the sale proceeds in question did not form part of the turnover at all, there is no question of the same being deducted from the total turnover for the purpose of determining the taxable turnover.

15. The above decision of the Allahabad High Court was followed by the Kerala High Court in C.M Hamsa Haji,... v. Sales Tax Officer, Tirur,...., Tirur. In that case, a person transferred his business or stock- in- trade to a firm of which he was a partner as contribution of his capital therein. The Kerala High Court held that such a transaction did not amount to a sale of goods in the course of trade or business as a dealer within the meaning of the Kerala Sales Tax Act, 1963, since such a transaction did not involve any sale of goods and the transferor did not part with the property of goods, but only shared his rights therein with the other partners under the contract of partnership. The court also held that even assuming that there was a sale, it was not a sale in the course of trade or business nor was it a transaction by a dealer as defined in the Act.

16. The sale in the present case is of a running business as a going concern for a consideration of Rs. 19,500. It is the assessing authority which had taken the sale value of the closing stock as Rs. 18,929.71 and it is not as if the assessee himself sold the said closing stock for that price. The sale of the stock-in-trade for the purpose of closing down the business is different from the sale of the business as a whole as a running concern. The sale of a business, lock, stock and barrel, is not incidental or ancillary to the carrying on of a business so as to be taxable under the Act. Thus, from this point of view, the transaction in question will not fall within the scope of the Act at all and, therefore, the sale proceeds will not constitute a turnover as defined in the Act. If so considered, the question of neither exemption nor deduction can arise. We are reaching this conclusion independently of the conclusion we have arrived at with reference to rule 6(d) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Rules. As a matter of fact, this conclusion is only alternative to the said conclusion and is really based on considerations totally different from the considerations applicable to rule 6(d).""

11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc Income Tax Officer and Anr. (supra), was considering the assessee's appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 against the orders passed by the Tribunal holding that the transaction of sale of Kalyan business was not a slump sale. The Court in such context, considered the question inter alia whether there was a slump sale or a sale of itemized assets. The Court held that as the entire Kalyan business has been sold by the assessee to one PPL as a going concern, the intention of the parties in the commercial sense was to transfer the business as a whole for a lump sum consideration and that the parties did not intend to make a sale of itemized assets. It was observed that the purchaser never intended to purchase individual items and that apart from land, building, plant and machinery, the assessee had transferred business advantages like licenses, quotas, permission to use the corporate logo and a trade name. The Court observed that it was a case of a slump sale. Referring to the decision in CIT Vs. Narkeshari Prakashan Ltd., it was observed that mentioning of value / consideration in respect of land or building will not per se take the transaction out of slump sale. The nature of the BTA is not different from what was being considered by the Court in this case. Hence, the observations and conclusion on the principle of law that such transaction would be in the nature of a slump sale, is squarely applicable in the facts of",,,,,,,

(supra), a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was considering a reference made to it by a Division Bench doubting the correctness of an earlier decision in Coromandal Lubricants Vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes27, the following was the question which was answered by the Full Bench.


""Whether in a transaction of sale of an undertaking as a going concern with all assets and liabilities for a lump sum without stipulating any price for individual items, the assessing authority could consider that there was a sale of goods within the meaning of Section 2(n) read with Sections 2(h) and 2(s) for charging the same to tax under Section 5 of the APGST Act.""
The Full Bench considering several decisions on such issue observed that the question which would be required to be asked is whether there was an integral or even incidental connection between the transaction evidenced by the agreement and the carrying on of the business. The Court observed that when the assessee effects a sale not for the purpose of continuing the business, but for the purpose of putting an end to the business, such sale could not be sale in the course of business. The relevant observations are required to be noted :-


A.P. 102 STC 274
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc ""52. That apart, the elements of frequency, continuity of the transactions of sale and purchase which were stressed by Privy Council in Shaw Wallace case (supra) and reiterated by the Supreme Court in Raipur case (supra) and in Ansari's case (supra) are conspicuously lacking in the transfer of goods effected under the terms of the Business Sale Agreement. Ansari's case (supra) has firmly laid down the proposition that these tests cannot be abandoned even after the new definition of business. Here is a case in which the goods which would not have been disposed of while carrying on its normal business activity were ""sold out"" if that expression is appropriate, in furtherance of its scheme to close the business undertaking once and for all. Such an activity of sale marks the end point of the business of the assessee and it is not an event of frequent occurrence - not even capable of being ever repeated. We are therefore of the view that the assessee M/s.
Spectra Bottling Co., effecting the sale of goods in the course of business or carrying on the business intended to be pursued or continued, does not arise. In coming to this conclusion, we are eschewing from consideration whether or not the assessee was prompted by a profit motive in undertaking the sale of business as a whole and the sale of goods in particular.

53. The learned Government Pleader time and again stressed that the sale of this nature can be regarded as a sale incidental to the assessec's business. In other words, the sale of goods effected in furtherance of the object of disposing of the entire business falls within the second part of the definition of 'business', according to the learned Government Pleader. We find it difficult to accept this contention. When the entire movable property including plant, machinery, equipment and other capital assets are transferred together with its immovable and intangible assets, the assessee goes out of business. How can it be said that such a step is incidental to or connected with the manufacturing, trading or other business activity the assessee was hitherto carrying on? A step to close down and dispose of the entire business is obviously not incidental or complimentary to the business, that is to say, the manufacturing or trading activity which the assessee was carrying on. Hence, in our considered view, the second part of Section 2 (bbb) does not come into play at all. The second part of definition has art inextricable link with the first part. The transaction contemplated by second part should be some thing which takes place in the process and in the context of continued business activity and having the effect of aiding or promoting such business. That is not the case here. The second part has definitely no application to the case of Spectra Bottling Co.

68. The Rule was framed on the assumption that in a case of sale of business as a whole, the proceeds of sale may be taxable. It is axiomatic that the Rule cannot go counter to the charging provision and other provisions of the Act. If there is no sale within the meaning of Section 2(n) of the Act read with the definition of 'business' and 'dealer', the liability to tax cannot arise from the operation of this Rule, nor has it got the effect of bringing within the sweep of taxation transactions which are otherwise not exigible to tax. The Rule cannot be so construed as to derogate from the scheme of the Act. But, it is only intended to provide a limited relief to those who are otherwise liable to pay tax. If the tax is not liable to be paid under the main provisions of the Act, the question of resort to the Rule does not arise. Nor does the understanding of the rule-making authority control the meaning to be assigned to the concepts of 'sale' and 'business'. As Sethuraman, J., observed in DIT v. K. Behanan Thomas (supra), ""If the amount in question will not fall within the scope of the Act at all, the question of either deduction or exemption will not arise"". Rule 6(h) does not therefore, render any assistance to the case of the respondents. With great respect, the learned Judges who decided Coromandal Lubricants case (supra) were not right in reinforcing their view point by reference to Rule 6(h).",,,,,,,

""15 It was contended that when a dealer sells his business there may be some stock-in-trade which is sold along with the goodwill and that there is no reason why proceeds of the sale of the stock- in-trade should not be included in his turnover even though proceeds of the sate of the goodwill are excludes. It may be accepted that when a business is sold along with stock-in-trade, that is, the goods remaining unsold, proceeds of the sale of the latter should be included in the turnover, in the present case though the assesses has sold some stock-in-trade along with its
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc business, the amount of the proceeds of the sale of it is not shown separately from the amount of the proceeds of the sale of the goodwill etc., and it is not possible to say that a particular portion of the proceeds of the sale of the business should be included in the turnover. Our reply to the question is that proceeds of sale of the business sold by the assessee are not to be included in the turnover over which tax is payable under Section 3 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act and that no question of goods being single point goods or multiple point goods can possibly arise. Further Rule 44(f) is of general application and applies in all cases regardless of the question of goods being single point goods or multiple point goods. We direct that copies of this judgment shall be sent under the seal of the Court and the signature of the Registrar to the Judge (Revisions) sales Tax and the Commissioner of Sales Tax, U. P., as required by Section 11 (6). We further direct that the commissioner of sales tax will get his costs or this reference, which we fix at Rs. 100/-.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"80. The Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in the case of Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax Vs. M/s. Dat Pathe (supra), examined as to what would attract a tax in a sale of goods by dealer in the course of business. The Court held that when a business is sold as a going concern the buyer might in his turn sell the goods in the course of his business and such sale would be exigible to tax. The relevant observations reads thus :-

""What attracts tax is the sale of goods by a dealer in the course of business. It would be illogical and fallacious to equate that for the purpose of Rule 9(g) with the sale of a particular business conducted by the assessee as a going concern. True it is, in the case of sale of business as a whole also there might be transfer of property in the goods in which the assessee is a dealer. The value of such goods is not always separately estimated or fixed. The percentage of the value of such goods in relation to the total amount realised by the sale of the business as a whole could vary from case to case. When we bear in mind the definition of the expressions ""business"", ""turnover"", ""total turnover"" and ""taxable turnover"" contained in the Act, we could find that the taxable
-------------------------

When a business is sold as a going concern, the buyer might in his turn, sell the goods in the course of his business, and such sale would be exigible to tax ; if at the time of the sale of the business as a whole and also at the later stage, when the buyer from the assessee sells the goods, tax is levied or collected, the effect would be that the goods are being subjected to double taxation. The Legislature presumably wanted to avoid such an anomaly and be fair and reasonable.""",,,,,,,

State of Telangana (supra), a Division Bench of the High Court of the State of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad, held the writ petition under Article 226 to be maintainable by holding that it was a case where the assessing officer had lacked jurisdiction as also that the principles of natural justice had stood vitiated. The Court was dealing with a case of business transfer or a slump sale as an ongoing concern and that a Business Transfer Agreement was entered into by the assessee with the company. The Court held that the assessing officer had taken the consideration fixed, under the Business Transfer Agreement for every item of assets as the sale of individual items of goods including goodwill and confirmed the demand made in the show cause notice. The Court observed that the assessing officer was completely wrong in thinking that the sale of business as a whole was taxable simply because such a sale also involved a sale of several items used in the course of business. The relevant observations reads thus:

,,,,"82. In view of the above discussion, we are unable to agree with the submissions of Mr.Sonpal that the BTA would attract tax as held by the impugned order relying on the decision in Vikas Sales Corporation Vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (supra). As noted hereinabove, no doubt incorporeal rights are considered as goods by the Supreme Court in this decision, however, the context in which this was held cannot be applied to the facts of the present case, as the question before the Court was not the question which is posed for our consideration in the present

Licence/Exim Scrip by the holder thereof to another person constitutes a sale of goods within the meaning of and for the purposes of the Sales Tax enactments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala and in such context, the Court observed that the expression ""movable property""

would include corporeal as well as incorporeal property and that patents, copyrights and other rights in rem would also stand included within the meaning of movable property. However, in the present case, in the context of the BTA, it was not correct for the reviewing authority to include such property as enlisted in Schedule 3.3, so as to be included in the turnover of sale of the petitioner. The amounts qua each of such intangible items as specified in Schedule 3.3 certainly could not have been regarded as the itemized amounts of sale price received by the petitioner on sale of goods, as would be understood in the usual course of business, much less considering that it is the sale of business in its entirety as comprehended under the BTA. For such reason, it was completely a flawed approach on the part of the reviewing authority to tax such part of the BTA considering the same to be petitioner's sales/turnover of sales, for the financial year 2010-11 qua the amounts of the intangible assets as set out in schedule 3.3 of the BTA. Thus, in the context of the BTA, the
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc reviewing authority could not have regarded such intangible items to be in any manner ""sale of goods"", so as to fall within the petitioner's turnover of sales. We may also observe that merely for the reason that schedule 'C' of the MVAT Act under item 39 provides for ""goods of intangible or incorporeal nature"" that would not mean that de hors the context the BTA intended to achieve, the reviewing authority could not have arbitrarily singled out and/or picked up Schedule 3.3 and tax the items in question as contained therein to be the petitioner's turnover of sales for the said financial year. It would not be permissible for the reviewing authority to disintegrate the BTA and to attribute a different effect to the BTA which was far from realistic and in fact destructive of the BTA.",,,,,,,
,,,,"83. We, accordingly, answer the questions as encased hereinabove in paragraph 46 to hold that in the facts of the present case slump sale under the BTA would not amount to sale of goods within the purview of the MVAT Act, attracting any tax in the manner as held in the impugned order. We further hold that the reviewing authority acted in excess of jurisdiction in passing the impugned order. We also hold the impugned order to be vitiated and illegal even on the other issues as discussed hereinabove.

,,,,"84. Mr. Sonpal's contention is also to the effect that there is no prohibition in the statute that the reviewing authority ought not travel beyond the show cause notice so as to render the show cause notice bad in law. Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai vs. Amitabh Bachchan (supra), we may observe that such decision is rendered in the context of the revisional powers under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It is in such context, the Supreme Court has observed that as far as section 263 is concerned, what has to be seen is the satisfaction that an order passed by the authority under the Act is erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, is the basic condition for exercise of such jurisdiction under the said provision. It was observed that once such satisfaction is reached, jurisdiction to exercise the power would be available subject to the principles of natural justice which has been observed to be implicit in the requirement casts by the Section to give the assessee an opportunity of being heard.",,,,,,,
,,,,"85. Insofar as the respondent's contention that the petition ought not to be entertained as the petitioner has an alternate remedy of assailing the order in review by taking recourse to the remedy of an appeal, in our
-------------------------
11 June, 2024 wp 2836-21.doc opinion, is not tenable in the present facts. We may observe that once the impugned order is passed in excess of jurisdiction or in improper exercise of jurisdiction when it brings about severe civil consequences, it cannot be accepted as an absolute proposition, that merely as an alternate remedy is available to the petitioner, the petitioner cannot approach the High Court so as to seek a relief under the provisions of Article 226 of the Constitution and if he approaches the High Court would not entertain his writ petition. The law in this regard is well settled. We may refer to a recent decision of the Supreme Court in Godrej Sara Lee Limited (supra) wherein the Supreme Court has held that the mere fact that the petitioner before the High Court in a given case has not pursued the alternate remedy available to him, cannot mechanically be construed as a ground for its dismissal. It was held that High Courts bearing in mind, facts of each particular case, have the discretion whether to entertain the writ petition or not, this being one of the self imposed restrictions evolved through judicial precedents namely that the High Courts should normally not entertain a writ petition, where an effective and efficacious alternative remedy is available and that mere availability of an alternative remedy of appeal and revision would not oust the jurisdiction of High Court and render a writ petition not maintainable.

The petitioner also addressed a detailed letter dated 4 January 2018 to the SEBI stating that he was never in any direct or indirect control of Shrenuj, and that he never held any post in the company; that he was unaware of the company having allegedly violated the (LODR) Regulations. He further stated that he was named as an investor promoter of Shrenuj and company at the time of its incorporation in the year 1989 and that he had never been a director of the company or involved in any of its day to day affairs.

The Petitioner had remained as an ordinary shareholder of Shrenuj qua his limited shareholding. He was never a director of the company. He was never involved with the company, in any other capacity, in managing the affairs of the company. Such specific case of the petitioner appears to have gone unchallenged. Shrenuj suffered losses. It had also defaulted in complying with certain regulations as issued by the SEBI under the provisions of the SEBI Act and regulations sometime in the year 2016, at which point of time, status of the petitioner was nothing but merely of a shareholder of the company. It would be appropriate to note the default of Shrenuj as informed to Shrenuj by the Bombay Stock Exchange by its letter dated 2 March 2017 imposing a penalty/fine on Shrenuj for non-compliance of the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations.

It is hence, the petitioner's submission that the compliance of all the obligations under the SEBI Act and the regulations made thereunder was the obligation of the company as managed by its Board of Directors.

Certainly, no obligation of this nature appears to have been crystallized in a manner known to law qua the petitioner. Thus, such obligation cannot be fastened on the petitioner by an action of freezing the petitioner's demat accounts. If such an obligation is to be enforced, there are several facts which would be required to be taken into consideration to determine the role of the person whether he is the promoter at the relevant time considering the relevant facts and in the real sense as the law would mandate.

The petitioner has contended that his father is a practicing gynecologist with about 40 years of practice and even if he was to be branded as a 'promoter' of Shrenuj, merely because of his investments into his father in law's company as a shareholder, his father was never a promoter or director of the listed entity.

,,,,"52. On a plain reading of the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act as noted above, we do not find any explicit provisions that the SEBI would have a power to attach the demat account of the promoter much less qua the securities he would hold of companies other than the one of which he is a promoter. Further, none of the provisions postulate such drastic order to be passed against the promoter which is in the nature of a penalty without even a notice being furnished to him. Further, on a perusal of Regulation 98(1)(c) & (d) of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015, it clearly provides that listed entity or any other person thereof, who contravenes any of the provisions of the regulations, shall be held liable by the respective stock exchange(s) for actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, ""freezing of promoter/promoter group holding"", of designated securities, as may be applicable, in coordination with depositories or any other action as may be specified by the Board from time to time. Clause (2) of regulation 98 provides that the manner of revocation of actions specified in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-regulation (1), shall be as specified in circulars or guidelines issued by the Board.",,,,"54. We may also observe that the SEBI's contention referring to Regulation 98 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, being applicable so as to justify the freezing of the petitioner's demat account also cannot be accepted. This for the reason that we are not shown any primary obligation as fixed on the promoters and that too at a stage after almost 29 years of the formation of the company (Shrenuj), that the promoter nonetheless, would have certain obligations to be discharged under the Act and/or the Regulations. In our opinion, unless such basic obligation is statutorily fastened on the promoter, Regulation 98 cannot be applied in vacuum and moreso considering the facts and circumstances of the present case.
",,"(v) Having regard to our discussion and conclusion, we keep open all issues of law on the challenge raised by the petitioner to the legality of the statutory regulations.",
,,,,"55. The object of SEBI (LODR) Regulation primarily concerns the listing obligations and a disclosure requirement to be complied by a company. In the present case, the company was formed in the year 1989, and after all statutory compliances, it was listed on the Bombay Stock",,,,"sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt Exchange. We are not shown any material that the petitioner did not cease to have any role, after the company was formed and/or till it defaulted under the said Regulation although it was managed by the Board of Directors. None of the respondents have showed any active role of the petitioner in the capacity of the promoter, in the management of the company and any role and obligation factually fastened on the petitioner in the various compliance which are required to be undertaken under the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, at the time of the freezing of his demat accounts. It is, therefore, difficult to accept that the listing obligations as postulated under the SEBI (LODR) Regulations were at all applicable qua the petitioner, so as to apply Regulation 98(1)(c) in freezing the demat account of the petitioner. We may observe that in the circumstances in hand when a basic obligation under the Regulations itself is not conferred on the promoter of the nature petitioner is, there could not have been a corresponding duty and a consequent default, attributable for any action to be taken under Regulation 98.
",,(vi) The petition stands allowed in the aforesaid terms.,
,,,,"56. As we are dealing with the freezing of the demat accounts of the promoter, it would be relevant to consider the definition of the word 'promoter' as defined under clause (za) of Regulation 2 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 which is extracted hereunder:

Provided that a director or officer of the issuer or a person, if acting as such merely in his professional capacity, shall not be deemed as a promoter:
Provided further that a financial institution, scheduled bank, foreign portfolio investor other than Category III foreign portfolio investor and mutual fund shall not be deemed to be a promoter merely by virtue of the fact that ten per cent. or more of the equity share capital of the issuer is held by such person;

2(69) ""promoter"" means a person --
(a) who has been named as such in a prospectus or is identified by the company in the annual return referred to in section 92; or
(b) who has control over the affairs of the company, directly or indirectly whether as a shareholder, director or otherwise; or

We are of the opinion that the above principles would necessarily apply when any action under the SEBI Act or Regulations framed thereunder is being taken against any promoter. This would necessarily involve robust evidence to be available and considered in regard to the role of the promoter not only qua the company but also whether any active role of the promoter exists qua the shareholders at large and whether the fiduciary capacity in which the promoter is required to discharge his role in formation of a company, would still bind him for various compliances, under the SEBI Regulations or it would be the liability of the company managed by the Board of Directors for achieving all the compliances, which are necessary to protect the interest of the investors who subscribe to the shares of a company. If there is no consideration and examination of such essential attributes before taking any action against the promoters, it would certainly lead to a serious prejudice and / or even a gross absurdity, rendering any action of penalty or freezing of any demat account of a promoter, as in the present case to be grossly arbitrary and illegal.

Thus, clause (a) of Section 2(69) of the Companies Act, 2013 refers to a de jure position, where a person is expressly named in a prospectus or is identified by the company as a promoter in the annual return referred to in Section 92. Clause (b) and (c) describes a de facto position where a promoter is a person who has control over the affairs of the company, directly or indirectly, whether as a shareholder, director or otherwise; clause (c) provides that the Board of Directors of the company is accustomed to act in accordance with the advice, directions or instructions of such person. Proviso to section 2(69) (supra) ordains that the provisions of sub-clause (c) shall not apply to a person who is acting merely in a professional capacity.",,,,"Now, what are the facts here? As I have indicated the question of promotion only applies to the first respondent. It is said that he must be deemed to have taken part in the formation of the Company and to be a promoter because he signed the Memorandum and Articles of Association and subscribed for 100 shares. There is no evidence showing that he took any part in discussing the formation of the Company or in taking any steps to bring the Company into being, apart from the fact that he signed the Memorandum of Association and paid for 100 shares. It is not even suggested that he had anything to do with the drawing up of the Memorandum and Articles of Association. There is no suggestion that the first respondent had anything to do with the selection of the Directors or the settlement of any contract, except the contract under which his firm was to act as brokers. After the Company had been formed and had started business the first respondent's firm induced certain people to subscribe for shares, but it is not alleged that they did anything before the Company was launched. The minimum subscription was fixed at 500 shares and the signatories to the Memorandum of Association themselves subscribed for 1200 shares . In the Memorandum of Association the only persons referred to as promoters are V.K. Lakshmana Mudaliar and J.W. Samuel. It comes to this. The Court is asked to hold the first respondent to be a promoter because his signature appears at the foot of the Memorandum and he took 100 shares of the 1200 initially subscribed. This is a contention which I am unable to accept. The law requires that there shall be seven signatories to the Memorandum of Association of a public Company. A person who

Thus, assuming that the SEBI/BES/NSE intends to justify its action to take the petitioner as the promoter, it has to look into the last annual return filed by Shrenuj and its declaration qua the promoters as per the requirement of Section 92(1)(e). It cannot take a recourse to what was the position when the company was formed, i.e., in the year 1989. It was necessary for the SEBI/NSDL to look into the last return as filed by the company which in the present case would be of the year 2014 to 2016 which is of the period just prior to the default by Shrenuj.

It was mentioned in the course of the argument that the money subscribed by the first respondent for his 100 shares was utilised in defraying part of the expenses of forming the Company. That may be, but it was a matter which concerned the directors. The application of the money which the first respondent paid for his shares was a matter over which he had no control, and the fact that the money was utilised in paying the expenses of formation, cannot make him a promoter. The agreement with the respondents was an agreement which conscientious directors ought never to have entered into and in doing so the directors deliberately exceeded their powers. But this, of course, has nothing to do with the question whether the first respondent is to be deemed to be a person who took part in the formation and promotion of the Company. For the reasons indicated it must he held that the Official Liquidator was not entitled to take out a summons against the first respondent on the ground that he was a promoter.""

Ramaiya in his celebrated work ""Guide to the Companies Act"" 18th Ed. Vol. 1, when on the role of the promoter, is described as under :-

The term is not one of law but familiar to the business world. It points to a person who forms a company and gets it going. It indicates 'a person who originates the scheme for the formation of the company, has the Memorandum and Articles prepared, executed and registered, and finds the first directors, settles the term of the preliminary contracts and prospectus (if any) and makes arrangement for advertising and circulating the prospectus and placing the capital, is emphatically a promoter in the fullest sense'. He controls the formation and future of the company, and it is this control which lies at the root of the fiduciary relation of the promoter to the company. Nor is he less a promoter if all or most of these activities are performed nominally by a company which he controls.
.......
The question whether a person is or is not a promoter is a question of fact, depending upon what he really did in connection with the formation of the company. [ Lydney and Wigpool Iron Ore Co. v. Bird, (1886) 33 Ch D 85] .......
A person cannot become a promoter merely because he signed the memorandum as a subscriber for one or more shares.[ Official Liquidator v. VeluMudaliar, (1938) 8 Com Cases 7 : AIR 1938 Mad 192] ....But persons who act in a professional capacity such as counsels, solicitors, accountants, engineers or other technicians, will not become promoters by reason of so acting, unless they exceed their professional function and do anything or take any interest in promoting the company.

Thus, applying such settled position in the context of the present case, the petitioner, a practicing gyneacologist, did not exceed his professional position, to take interest in the formation of Shrenuj or to promote or manage its day-to-day affairs. Also, after the incorporation of the company and constitution of the Board of Directors, the status and role of the petitioner as a promoter had come to an end. Hence, the obligation of non-submission of Financial Results and non-compliance with the provisions of SEBI (LODR) Regulations could not have been fastened and imposed on the petitioner.

The petitioner is a non-resident Indian currently residing in Singapore. He is also an angel investor investing in promising start-ups in India.

The observations of Lindley, L.J. which are of signifcance in the context of the role of the promoter qua a company read thus:

""Moreover, to say that James Bird was a promoter of the company and therefore liable to account to it, is calculated to mislead; for the word 'promoter' is ambiguous, and it is necessary to ascertain in each case what the so-called promoter really did before his legal liabilities can be accurately ascertained, and that in every case it is better to look at the facts and ascertain and describe them as they are.""

There is another facet which also needs to be commented that the freezing of the petitioner's demat account as set out in the reply affidavit filed on behalf of SEBI, is regarded inter alia to be in the nature of a penalty/fine, as also seen from the letter dated 2 March 2017 (supra), addressed by the BSE to Shrenuj, and it is for defalut of Shrenuj, the petitioner is being penalised by the impugned action. Insofar as the applicability of the principles of law is concerned, it would not make much difference as to whether what is sought to be recovered from the petitioner is penalty or fine. The reason for this being that a penalty would include fine. A categorical stand is taken on behalf of the SEBI/BSE that a penalty / fine being imposed on Shrenuj is sought to be recovered by the impugned action of the freezing of the petitioner's demat account. It would be appropriate to note the jurisprudential meaning attributed to the terms 'penalty' and 'fine' and in the present context. We may usefully refer to the following extract from Advanced Law Lexicon of P. Ramanatha Aiyar, 3rd Edition, when the learned author distinguished fine from penalty.

""DISTINGUISHED FROM ""penalty"". In its broadest sense ""penalty"" includes fines, as well as all other kinds of punishment. (Esselink v. Campbell, 4 lowa. 296.)

The petitioner has certainly suffered such illegality and for a long period of six years, which has prevented him from operating his demat account and dealing with the shares held by him other than of Shrenuj. The petitioner has categorically averred that looking at his age, the funds were to be utilized by him for his retirement. We would not expect any person to suffer in such manner and that too in a high-handed and arbitrary manner as in the present case. As noted hereinabove, we are of the clear opinion that BSE/NSE as also SEBI has clearly failed to discharge their duties and to act in accordance with law so as to deprive the petitioner of his shares in the demat account held by him which certainly, in our opinion, is an infringement of petitioner's right guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 300A of the Constitution. Any casual approach to such infringement certainly would not be an acceptable approach and in fact would strengthen the hands of these authorities to repeat such illegalities. In fact if we fail to impose costs, it would amount to putting a premium on such illegality of these respondents. In these circumstances, although we are not inclined to grant an amount of Rs.2 crores as compensation / cost in favour of the petitioner, we are inclined to award an amount of Rs.30 lakhs to be paid to the petitioner by BSE/NSE/SEBI, which shall be jointly paid.

We are not shown any specific power as conferred on the SEBI under the SEBI Act which would confer any authority to freeze the demat account of the promoter qua the shares held by him of a company other than of the defaulting company of which he is a promoter or any other office bearer.

It is the petitioner's case that in July 2018, the petitioner found that his demat account was frozen without any notice or intimation to him.

As freezing of the petitioner's account for recovery of the amounts levied as penalty / fine is being resorted, the arguments as advanced on behalf of the petitioner of due adherence to the provisions of Section 15- A, 15-I and 15-J also become imperative. It cannot be overlooked that section 15A of the SEBI Act provides for a penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. and the amount of penalty it prescribes at different amounts as set out in clause (a), (b) and (c). However, for imposing of such penalty, the provisions of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act stand attracted for an adjudication by an adjudicating officer, by a procedure under Section 15-I and 15-J of the SEBI Act.",,,,"sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt October 2019 stating that since the petitioner is a joint holder with Mr. Pradeep Mehta (promoter of Shrenuj and Company which was compulsorily delisted from the Exchange w.e.f. 4 July 2018), hence, his request for defreezing of his demat account cannot be accepted. On the said reply being received by the petitioner from BSE, the petitioner addressed a detailed letter dated 21 April 2021 to the SEBI stating that he was never a promoter or director in the delisted entity and the fact that freezing power itself is illegal and goes against the basic statute of Companies Act.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the record on this petition. There is much substance in the contentions as urged on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned action in the present case crosses all boundaries of legitimacy, reasonableness, fairness, being the principles the statutory bodies like SEBI, BSE and NSE are required to adher being governed by statutes and regulations. We say so as in the present case ex-facie there were no reasons whatsoever, to freeze the petitioner's demat account which came to be freezed merely because the petitioner's father happens to be a second holder of his demat account. The petitioner in this case was never the promoter of Shrenuj. When the petition was filed, the petitioner was 39 years of age and when Shrenuj was promoted in the year 1989, the petitioner was 7 years of age, when his father Dr. Pradeep Mehta was styled as one of the promoters of Shrenuj.

-------------------------


sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi & Ors. 6 held that 'civil consequences' cover infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations, and non-pecuniary damages. The relevant observations read thus:

""66. It was argued, based on rulings relating to natural jus- tice, that unless civil consequences ensued, hearing was not nec- essary. A civil right being adversely affected is a sine qua non for the invocation of the audi alteram partem rule. This submission was supported by observations in Ram Gopal [Ram Gopal Chaturvedi v. State of M.P., (1969) 2 SCC 240 : (1970) 1 SCR 472], Col. Sinha [Union of India v. Col. J.N. Sinha, (1970) 2 SCC 458 : (1971) 1 SCR 791] . Of course, we agree that if only spiritual censure is the penalty, temporal laws may not take cog- nizance of such consequences since human law operates in the material field although its vitality vicariously depends on its morality. But what is a civil consequence, let us ask ourselves, by- passing verbal booby-traps? 'Civil consequences' undoubtedly cover infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and non-pecuniary damages. In its comprehensive connotation, everything that affects a citi- zen in his civil life inflicts a civil consequence. ""Civil"" is defined by Black (Law Dictionary, 4th Edn.) at p. 311:
""Ordinarily, pertaining or appropriate to a member of a civitas of free political community; natural or proper to a citizen. Also, relating to the community, or to the policy and govern- ment of the citizens and subjects of a state.
The word is derived from the Latin civilis, a citizen .... In law, it has various significations.
*** 'Civil Rights' are such as belong to every citizen of the State or country, or, in a wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organisation or administration of Govern- ment. They include the rights of property, marriage, protec- tion by the laws, freedom of contract, trial by jury etc.... Or, as otherwise defined, civil rights are rights appertaining to a per- son in virtue of his citizenship in a State or community. Rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action. Also a term applied to certain rights secured to citizens of the United States by the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, and by various acts of Congress made in pur- suance thereof.
6 AIR 1978 SC 851.",,,,"100. In our opinion, the present case is more gross and is a classic example of high-handed action and a reckless action to freeze the demat account of the petitioner. There is patent non-application of mind by any of these authorities, who are statutorily governed in resorting to take such drastic action. This apart, even the elementary principles of natural justice of a fair opportunity of calling upon the petitioner to show cause, a hearing and appropriate order to be passed have been thrown to the winds. This is certainly not the manner or method in which the rule of law would mandate these respondents to act.

The most valuable right in a democratic polity is the ""little man's"" little pencil-marking, assenting or dissenting, called his vote. A democratic right, if denied, inflicts civil consequences. Likewise, the little man's right, in a representative system of Gov- ernment, to rise to Prime Ministership or Presidentship by use of the right to be candidate, cannot be wished away by calling it of no civil moment. It civics mean anything to a self-governing citi- zenry, if participatory democracy is not to be scuttled by the law, we shall not be captivated by catchwords. The straight forward conclusion is that every Indian has a right to elect and be elected and this is a constitutional as distinguished from a common law right and is entitled to cognizance by courts subject to statutory regulation. We may also notice the further refinement urged that a right accrues to a candidate only when he is declared returned and until then it is incipient, inchoate and intangible for legal as- sertion -- in the twilight zone of expectancy, as it were. This too, in our view, is logicid sophistry. Our system of ""ordered"" rights cannot disclaim cognizance of orderly processes as the right means to a right end. Our jurisprudence is not so jejune as to ig- nore the concern with means as with the end, with the journey as with the destination. Every candidate, to put it cryptically, has an interest or right to fair and free and legally run election. To draw lots and decide who wins, if announced as the electoral method- ology, affects his right, apart from his luckless rejection at the end. A vested interest in the prescribed process is a processual right, actionable if breached, the Constitution permitting. What is inchoate, viewed from the end, may be complete, viewed mid- stream. It is a subtle fallacy to confuse between the two. Victory is still an expectation; qua mado is a right to the statutory proce- dure. The appellant has a right to have the election conducted not according to humour or hubris but according to law and jus- tice. And so natural justice cannot be stumped out on this score. In the region of public law locus standi and person aggrieved, right and interest have a broader import. But, in the present case, the Election Commission contends that a hearing has been given although the appellant retorts that a vacuous meeting where nothing was disclosed and he was summarily told off would be strange electoral justice. We express no opinion on the factum or adequacy of the hearing but hold that where a candidate has reached the end of the battle and the whole poll is upset, he has a right to notice and to be heard, the quantum and quality being conditioned by the concatenation of circumstances.""",,,,"101. The petitioner has suffered at the hands of respondents for these many years.

sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt Bank of India & Ors. vs. Rajesh Agarwal & Ors.7 on challenge to Master Directions on Fraud issued by Reserve Bank of India, the Supreme Court observed thus:

""32. .........It is now a settled principle of law that the rule of audi alteram partem applies to administrative actions, apart from judicial and quasi-judicial functions. It is also a settled position in administrative law that it is mandatory to provide for an opportunity of being heard when an administrative action results in civil consequences to a person or entity.
33. In State of Orissa v. Dr (Miss) Binapani Dei, a two-judge bench of this Court held that every authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action has a duty to give a reasonable opportunity to be heard. This Court further held that an administrative action which involves civil consequences must be made consistent with the rules of natural justice:
""9. [...] The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set-up that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the State or its officers. Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed: it need not be shown to be super-added. If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person, duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power. If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person is made, the order is a nullity. That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case.""
34. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, a seven-judge bench of this court held that any person prejudicially affected by a decision of the authority entailing civil consequences must be given an opportunity of being heard. This has been reiterated in a catena of decisions of this Court. In view of the settled position of law, the next question that arises before us is the scope and definition of the phrase 'civil consequences'.

Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that 'civil consequences' cover infraction of not merely property or personal 7 (2023) 6 SCC 1.",,,,"sebi-wp-1590-21 24-8-24 final (2).odt and circumstances of the case which would stare at them. There is not a semblance of reason for such action to be taken against the petitioner. We may also observe that the actions and cundect of the BSE / NSE and SEBI as the law mandates is to protect the interest of the investors. In the present case these statutory bodies have totally acted contratry to such norms. In fact the impugned actions of these respondents when taken against a person like the petitioner is also likely to shake the confidence of investors who are non residents Indian. This is certainly not what can be expected from the conduct of these entities. The duty to safeguard the investor's sentiments and confidence is paramount which stand breached in every possible manner in the present case.

In that case, the Court held that denial of a democratic right to cast a vote inflicts civil consequences. In D K Yadav v. J M A Industries, a three-judge bench of this Court observed that ""everything that affects a citizen in his civil life inflicts a civil consequence.""

36. In Canara Bank v. V K Awasthy, a two-judge bench of this Court succinctly summarized the history, scope, and application of the principles of natural justice to administrative actions involving civil consequences in the following terms:

""14. Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years. Rules of natural justice are not rules embodied always expressly in a statute or in rules framed thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute. What particular rule of natural justice should be implied and what its context should be in a given case must depend to a great extent on the fact and circumstances of that case, the framework of the statute under which the enquiry is held. The old distinction between a judicial act and an administrative act has withered away. Even an administrative order which involves civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The expression ""civil consequences"" encompasses infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything that affects a citizen in his civil life.""",,,,,,,

The provisions of Section 19 of the Depositories Act confers power on the SEBI to give directions in certain cases. Section 19F provides for penalty for failure to comply with directions issued by Board under Section 19 of the Act. Section 19G provides for penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.

Section 19-I provides for factors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.

The recovery can also be in terms of what has been provided under Section 19F which necessarily attracts the provisions of Section 19H in regard to adjudication.

i) That the SCR Act, 1956 is enacted to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein and by providing for matters connected therewith. It inter alia makes provisions for recognition of stock exchanges, contracts and options in securities, listing of securities and for penalties and procedure. Section 9 which provides for power of recognized stock exchanges to make bye-laws, is relied on behalf of the respondents and more particularly Section 9(2)(o), which provides that the stock exchange would be empowered to make bye-laws in regard to levy and recovery of fees, fines and penalties.

These are as under:-

ii) Situations in which the author creates a work in the course of his employment etc. for the benefit or on behalf of someone else, also under Section 17;

Mr. Khambata has submitted that when an owner takes an assignment of copyright, the object is to take ownership of the copyright. The consideration which prompted that is not the object or purpose of the contract. Analysis of the contracts entered into by Novex will show that the contracts have not even said anything about the assignment being taken for the purpose of business of granting license. Even assuming the contract did say that the contract was for the purpose of doing the business of granting license that would only describe the motive of the contract i.e. the reason Novex desired to take the assignment but that motive would still not be the object of the contract. Thus, Defendants' contention that if Novex has taken an assignment solely for the purpose of doing business, in licensing, then the assignment is for an unlawful object and therefore void, under Section 23 of the Contract Act, is misconceived.",,128.

By the 1994 Amendment a new chapter - Chapter VII was introduced, which deals with 'copyright society'. He has submitted that the object of 1994 Amendment was to promote the Collective administration of rights through a Copyright Society, both varsha 17 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc for the benefit of the owner as well as general public. The copyright societies, on an ""authorization"" from the owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. As such, a Copyright Society fundamentally operated to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"". He has submitted that by its very nature therefore, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) an authorized agent and (ii) an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. He has submitted that reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses together with Sections 33 to 36 which have been introduced by 1994 Amendment Act was was merely to provide for registration and to regulate functioning of copyright societies. The amendments so introduced did not in any manner affect and/or circumscribe the rights of an owner to conduct its own affairs including granting of licenses by such owner. The ""sea change"" as sought to be contended by the Defendants is absolutely not evident from the 1994 Amendment or Notes on Clauses in this regard.

The Assignment Deeds have been executed for a substantial consideration between the music labels and Novex for transferring the 'on ground performance rights' in consonance with Section 18 of the Act. He has submitted that all that the Suit is concerned, is whether Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright and whether Novex has a right to prevent the infringement of its exclusive Copyright. Therefore, if it is held that Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright then what logically follows is that the Defendants have to be injuncted from infringing upon Novex's exclusive Copyright. This varsha 36 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc would be irrespective of whether or not there is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing Novex from carrying out the business of issuing licenses of its Copyrights.","8.

Mr. Khambata has submitted that Owner's right under Section 30 cannot be curtailed by Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that Defendants have alleged that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an owner of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. He has submitted that such an interpretation is ex facie incorrect because :

i) If the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendant is accepted, then Section 33(1) completely takes away the right granted by Section 30 of the Act. In such a case, Section 33(1) would effectively emasculate Section 30;
ii) Further, if Defendant's interpretation is accepted then a section in a chapter dealing with copyright varsha 24 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies would completely subordinate and emasculate the right of an owner under Section 30, a section which falls in a different Chapter dealing with licensing. If Parliament had intended to take away any part of the owner's right under Section 30 (even by subjecting it to the compulsory agency of a registered copyright society) then an express amendment to Section 30 would have been essential.","17. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent.

Mr. Kadam has submitted that in view of the aforementioned, the primary objective of copyright and provisions relating to copyright is being for the benefit and enjoyment and protection of the owner. He has also placed reliance on an extract from Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright Volume I, page 1503, Paragraphs 18-28 in this context.",,"164. Prima facie, I find that there is much merit in the submission on behalf of PPL and Novex that the above suits have been filed against the Defendants who are rank infringes as they have failed to obtain a license in respect of the works which they are exploiting. The present suits concern whether PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright and whether they have a right to prevent infringement of their exclusive copyright. This in my view would be irrespective of whether or not these is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing them from carrying on business of issuing licenses in respect of their copyright. In the event it is held that PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright then it would follow that the Defendants have to be prevented from infringing the copyright.",
,,,,9. Mr. Khambata has referred to the Right of an owner of copyright to license its work under Chapter VI of the Act. Under section 30 of the Chapter VI of the Act the Licences by owners of copyright have been provided. The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:,,28. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is also well settled that a statute is required to be harmoniously construed so that each provision is given effect to without defeating and/or destroying another.,"23. Mr. Khambata has referred to extract from Copinger and Skone James at Page 1540, wherein it is stated that the norm is that copyright licensing is done individually by the owners. It is only in situations where it becomes difficult or impossible for an owner to license his works individually that the need for Copyright Societies arises. The rationale for Copyright Societies is that it is the best means of protecting owners rights. Such Societies offer a facility to owners; they do not denude the owners of any of their rights.
","126. Mr. Narula has thereafter referred to the Copyright (Second Amendment) Bill, 1992 introduced in Loksabha is on 16 th July 1992. He has in this context referred to the statement of objects and reasons and the Notes on Clauses appended to the 1992 Bill which clearly shows the intent of 1992 Bill. This was revised and modified by the Legislature before the enactment of the 1994 Amendment. He has submitted that it is important to note that Section 33(1) as proposed in the 1992 Bill did not contain the 1 st 40 [(1997) 2 SCC 820] varsha 68 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso to Section 33(1). The same was introduced subsequently. Therefore, it is obvious that the legislative intent initially was to impose a complete prohibition on any person or association to carry on the business of issuing or granting license except in accordance to the registration granted under Section 33(3) of the Act.",,"165. Accordingly, the issue as to whether PPL and Novex as Plaintiffs in the above suits are entitled to seek reliefs as varsha 86 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act is answered in the affirmative.",
,,,,"10. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Section 30 applies to an ""owner"". An ""owner"" as is clear from Section 18(2) and as mentioned above includes an ""assignee"". Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers ""duly authorized agent"" of the owner, to grant license. He has referred to Section 30 (A) of the Act and has submitted that this makes it very clear that the provisions of Section 30 apply to licensing in the same way as the provisions of Section 19 apply to an assignment. Therefore, the Act allows an ""owner"" to grant a license directly or through an agent under Section 30 and then sets out the varsha 16 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc procedure for licensing by specifying that what applies to assignment would apply to licensing as well.",,"40. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the defendants have contended that the words 'individual capacity' in Section 33(1) is the opposite of business and therefore an owner licensing his works in his individual capacity would not be doing business as per Section 33(1) of the Act. He has submitted that this argument is also completely untenable since there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the words individual capacity is the opposite of business. He has submitted that a company can also do business in its individual capacity. He has submitted that the use of the expression ' carrying on business' must be interpreted contextually. The same would not cover the owners' activity of carrying on business and include carrying on business of issuing licenses in its own name but in which others hold copyright. Hence, the expression ""individual capacity"" in Section 33(1) must be interpreted as meaning only anything opposed to ""collective capacity""

i.e. through a society. That is collective administration of owner's rights.","27. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the word 'business' has no technical meaning but is to be read with reference to the object and context of the Act in which it occurs. The interpretation necessarily has to be ""contextual"". He has submitted that for this purpose it is 3 AIR 1961 SC 112 4Order dated 17th July 2014 in NOM (L) No.1451 of 2014 in Suit (L) No.603 of 2014; 2014 SCC OnLine Bom 1324.

Shenoy, learned counsel for the Defendant in Commercial Suit No. 37362 of 2022, has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapur and has relied upon the 'Mischief Rule' of Statutory Interpretation, which has also been highlighted by Mr. Khambata in his submissions on behalf of Novex. He has also referred to the functions associated with the business of ""Collective Administration of Copyright"" and has submitted that what PPL did when they were varsha 69 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc registered as a copyright society and what they continue to do today (when not registered as a Copyright Society), through the artifice of taking limited partial assignments, is the same. He has referred to ""Copinger and Skone James"" (supra) on Copyright, which articulates the difference between ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" and ""Collective Administration of Rights"". He has submitted that an ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" is where each rightholder of copyright enters into agreements with prospective users of his work without ""banding together"" with other rightholders. Moreover, when it comes to certain categories of copyright, individual right holders may ""band together to exercise rights on a Collective basis"" This would involve all the individual rightholders pooling in their individual works to create a common repertoire of works in a single entity, which repertoire is then provided to a prospective user through that single entity. Any entity which manages this repertoire of works pooled together by individual rightholders, whether through assignment of ownership, licensing or agency in common parlance is considered to be a ""collecting society"" or a ""licensing body"",",,,
,,,,"11. Mr. Khambata has referred to Sections 31, 31(A) to 31(D) of the Act which give a whole scheme of regulations for granting licenses compulsorily to the public. These sections fetter the right of the owner in the matter of grant of licences. He has submitted that the scheme of these sections contemplates notice to be issued to the ""owner"" to secure such licences thereby recognizing the primacy of the ""owner's right to licence"". The term owner is used in these sections not a ""registered copyright society"". These Sections of the Act envisage that it is the ""owner"" of the Copyright who is entitled to grant licenses for consideration and if he charges an exorbitant consideration, there is a remedy provided in the Act itself. It is the ""owner"" who is also entitled to be heard and to be paid.",,,"31. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants have contended that ""business"" must be given the widest possible meaning and as such anything that is ""business"", including the grant of licenses varsha 27 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc by the owner is covered by Section 33 (1). He submitted that such a contention is completely counterproductive and in fact militates against the case of the Defendants. The wider the interpretation of the term ""business"", the greater the intrusion on the right available to the owner under Section 30. If business is interpreted as put forth by the Defendants, then in that case, 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy.
","145. Thus, this decision of the Supreme Court makes it clear that Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner. It only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.",,,
,,,,"14. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is necessary to refer in this context to Section 33 of Chapter VII of the Act, which is reproduced as under:-

Section 33 of the Act provides as follows;
""33. Registration of Copyright society.-- (1) No person or association of persons shall, after coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994 (38 of 1994) commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licences in respect of any work in which varsha 18 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc copyright subsists or in respect of any other rights conferred by this Act except under or in accordance with the registration granted under sub-section (3):
Provided that an owner of copyright shall, in his individual capacity, continue to have the right to grant licences in respect of his own works consistent with his obligations as a member of the registered copyright society:
Provided further that the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under this Act:
Provided also that a performing rights society functioning in accordance with the provisions of section 33 on the date immediately before the coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994 (38 of 1994) shall be deemed to be a copyright society for the purposes of this Chapter and every such society shall get itself registered within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994.
(2) Any association of persons who fulfils such conditions as may be prescribed may apply for permission to do the business specified in sub-section (1) to the Registrar of Copyrights who shall submit the varsha 19 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc application to the Central Government.

(3) The Central Government may, having regard to the interests of the authors and other owners of rights under this Act, the interest and convenience of the public and in particular of the groups of persons who are most likely to seek licences in respect of the relevant rights and the ability and professional competence of the applicants, register such association of persons as a copyright society subject to such conditions as may be prescribed:

Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works. (3A)...
(4)...
(5)...",,"41. Mr. Khambata has thereafter referred to the second Proviso to Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that prior to 2012 Amendment by which the second proviso was added to Section 33(1), the authors of the underlying work lost their rights to their works to the owners of the sound recording or the owners of the cinematograph film who had employed them to create the underlying work. In order to correct this specific mischief a proviso was added to Section 17 as well as Section 18 as per the 2012 Amendment Act. These provisos stated that even if an individual who has authored a work has been employed by someone else i.e. the owner of the copyright, the authors' rights to the underlying work would not be affected by the ownership of the copyright by the employer. He has referred to Minister's speech tabling the 2012 Amendment and has submitted that the second proviso was introduced to assuage the grievances and/or concerns of the ""author"" community and this can also be culled out from the statement of objects and reasons to the said amendment.","34. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the different chapters in an Act cover different demarcated aspects. Chapter VII of the Act covers 'Copyright Societies' and further expounds on the conditions of varsha 28 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the registration and other associated aspects, whereas Chapter VI of the Act creates a statutory right of licensing. He has submitted that a section which comes under Chapter VII dealing with copyright societies cannot in effect, take away a right granted under a completely different chapter. Particularly when the ""clearest of language"" in this regard as used in the second proviso is absent.
",,,,
,,,,"15. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the heading of Section 34 is clear that it deals with 'Administration of rights of an owner by a copyright society'. Thus, it it is somebody else's rights which are being administered and that owner can be an author, employer, proprietor, an assignee or someone who inherits it. Therefore, the copyright society is acting in a capacity similar to a manager/agent while administering the rights of the owner.",,"42. He has also referred to the speech of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting whilst tabling this amendment, which is in this context. Further he has also referred to Parliamentary Committee 227th Report- 2011 Bill from which the discussion on the amendment to Section 33 can be ascertained. He has submitted that it is clear therefrom that the object of the amendment was to augment /strengthen the eco system with respect to the ""author"" community and ensuring equal representation of ""authors"" and ""composers"" on one hand, and ""owners"" on the other, in copyright societies.","39. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the first proviso to Section 33(1) uses the phrase 'individual capacity'. He has submitted that the term individual capacity should not be considered to be equivalent to exercise of rights by individual authors or owners personally. It should rather be understood to mean any method other than collective management whereby right holders make their own decisions about exercise of the rights in the works.
",,,,
,,,,"16. Mr. Khambata has referred to Section 34(1)(a) which deals with the manner in which a copyright society would obtain varsha 20 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc authorization for administration which clearly conveys the intention to include both, the author and other owners of right which would include an 'assignee'. Further, Section 34(1)(b) of the Act contemplates that an author or other owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This shows that an author or other owner does not have to carry out the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).",,"43. Mr. Khambata has submitted that what is significant to note in the 2nd proviso is that there is a complete embargo on carrying on the business of issuing or granting license in respect of the underlying work and this business can be carried out ""only"" through a copyright society. Therefore, it is clear that when the legislature specifically wanted rights of owners / authors to be curtailed, there was a specific, clear and unambiguous provision. This language is absent in Section 33(1). He further submitted that if the Defendants argument is accepted that Section 33(1) prevented all owners, including authors, from doing the business of granting license of copyright, then there would be no need of the second proviso.","49. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the argument of the Defendants is that the assignment is obtained by the plaintiff for the purpose of issuing and granting licenses and therefore cannot be enforced before this Court in view of Section 33(1). Since there is no varsha 35 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc bar in the Act in obtaining an assignment, at best and without prejudice to the argument elucidated above and, in the alternative, the bar would kick in only in respect of the actual grant or issuance of licenses. That will not affect the right of an owner independently to bring a suit for infringement of copyright and seek reliefs.
",,,,
,,,,"18. Mr. Khambata has then referred to Section 35 (1) of the Act, wherein it is provided that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ...""",,44. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the second proviso was needed since the Parliament was clear that Section 33(1) did not prevent all owners including authors from licensing their copyrights for profit and since parliament wanted to draw distinction between the authors and the owners the second proviso became necessary. Hence it is specifically mentioned that licensing by the authors of the underlying works will only be done by the copyright society.,"50. Mr. Khambata has submitted that another fact is that the Defendants have no independent right of its own. They are rank infringers. The Defendants have not even attempted to justify their entitlement in exploiting the subject sound recordings and has merely sought to assail Novex's entitlement to seek reliefs on the ground that Novex is not a registered copyright society. Once it is observed that the right to seek relief for infringement is not jeopardized, the relief as sought by Novex must follow. This is clear from a reading of Sections 13, 14 r/w. 51 (a)(i).
",,,,
,,,,"20. Mr. Khambata has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"".1 He has submitted that the Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. A Copyright Society steps into the shoes of the author, it issues licenses on behalf of the author and files litigation on his behalf. The Supreme Court goes on to hold that as per Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Therefore, Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner, it only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.",,"45. Mr. Khambata has submitted that if the second proviso to Section 33(1) is clarificatory (as argued by the Defendants), this would mean that the Parliament only wished to clarify this position for underlying works and not for any other works. Therefore even this case as canvassed by the Defendants militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded by them. He has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. varsha 33 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Commissioner of Central Excise"".7 at Paragraph 21 held that 'Parliament is deemed to know the law and therefore the fact that the Parliament has amended Section 33(1) in 2012 by adding the second proviso shows that Parliament itself did not think Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works'.","57. Mr. Kadam has submitted that one of the objections raised by the Defendant is that PPL cannot sue without joining the owner in respect of the exclusively licensed works. He has referred to Section 54 of the Act, which provides that unless the context otherwise requires, the expression ""owner of copyright""

shall include an ""exclusive licensee"". Further Section 55 provides that where the copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright shall be entitled to all such remedies including an injunction. From a reading of Section 55 with Section 54, an exclusive licensee would be entitled as an owner of copyright for the purposes of Chapter XII to institute a Suit and seek an injunction in relation to an infringement of copyright in any work covered by the exclusive license.",,,,
,,,,21. The Supreme Court has concluded that Section 34 of the Act provides for administration of rights of owners by a copyright 1 (2008) 13 SCC 30 Para 66 varsha 22 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc society for all intent and purport creates a virtual agency so as to enable the society to act on behalf of the owner...(emphasis supplied).,,"46. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Phonographic Performance Limited v. Avion Hospitality Pvt Ltd & Ors. has set aside the view taken by a Learned Single Judge of this Court in ""Phonographic Performance Ltd vs City Organisers Pvt. Ltd."".8 which had accepted the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendants. The Division Bench in ""Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd."" (supra) accepted the interpretation placed by counsel for the Plaintiff on Section 33 read with Section 34 of the Act and had found that the learned Judge's attention was not invited to several provisions of the Act from which it can be construed that the Plaintiff-Novex has locus to file the suit or claim injunction.","74. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the purported assignment agreements relied upon by the Plaintiffs are void and do not validly transfer actual ownership rights to the Plaintiffs as: (i) they do not identify the ""work"" as required under Section 19(2); (ii) they fall foul of the requirement to specify payment of royalty to authors; (iii) they do not confer actual ownership rights but are designed only to circumvent Section 33(1); and (iv) in case of PPL, there is no assignment/transfer of ownership in respect of 40% of the sound recordings.

Mr. Khambata has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd."".9 does not assist the Defendant. He has submitted that the Madras High Court in the said decision has erroneously framed an issue whether Novex is entitled to grant licenses or not. The subject matter of the dispute before the Madras High Court was whether DXC Technology was infringing Novex's copyright or not, it wasn't whether 7[2016) 3 SCC page 643 8[Comm.

He has submitted that the Madras High Court had relied heavily upon the reasons for introducing the 2012 amendment, in support of its decision. The Madras High Court held that a careful examination of Section 18, 30 and 33 show that while the right of the owner in his individual capacity is retained, the right to carry on the ""business of issuing and granting licenses"" is taken away on account of the bar contained in Section 33(1) read with the second proviso. The judgment also holds that the word ""only""","77. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have not filed a simpliciter suit for injunction on grounds of infringement. On the contrary, their entire case is that they are entitled to issue licenses and collect license fees. On this basis, they have sought a limited injunction against the Defendants from playing sound recordings without taking a license from the Plaintiffs. This is evident from the Plaintiffs' own pleadings. He has relied upon Paragraphs Nos. 6,9,11,13,28 and 32 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraphs Nos. 4, 6, 9 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by Plaintiff's advocate in respect of the alleged infringement at page no. 59 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraph no. 8 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by 10 Order dated 22nd December 2017 in Commercial Appeal (L) no. 100 of 2017.

Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the Assignment Deeds are extremely specific and meet the requirements of Section 19. The Assignment Deeds categorically state that the ownership rights in the works are being assigned to Novex and there is no mention in the Assignment Deeds of the assignment being for the purpose of doing business in licensing. Therefore, the argument of the Defendants that the assignment is solely for the purpose of doing business in licensing must be rejected.","83. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL's and Novex's activities fall under Section 33 (1) of the Act and which is apparent from Clauses 3(a), 3(y), 3(z), 3(aa) and 3(ab) of its Memorandum of Association as well as 3.20 and 12 of its Articles of Association. This is also apparent from PPL's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022 which shows that its principal activity is granting 12 [(2016) UKSC 42] varsha 49 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc public performance licenses.

Equally, the fact that the Plaintiff is not a registered copyright society does not impair its ability to the reliefs as sought.","90. Dr,. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the plain language of Section 33(1) does not exclude owners/assignees.

,,,,"necessary to note the heading of Section 33 which is ""Registration of copyright society"". He has submitted that the heading of a section can be used to interpret the object and purpose of a Section. It is well settled that the headings of sections are substantive parts of the act and limit or explain their operation. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati"" (supra) which is the authority for this proposition. He has also referred to the heading of Section 34 of the Act which is ""Administration of rights of owner by copyright society"". He has submitted that Sections 33 and 34 of the Act must be read as respectively restricted to the subject described by these headings. Therefore, if a copyright society wants to do the business of issuing licenses, then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33; this is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling under Chapter VI of the Act.",,"55. Mr. Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the PPL has submitted that PPL owns and controls (by Exclusive Licenses) the public performance rights of various music labels which include both, international and domestic recordings. The repertoire of the recordings in which rights are assigned to PPL extend to around 400 labels and more than 45 lakh recordings. PPL issues licenses for public performances / communication to the public of sound recordings on the basis of exclusive rights assigned to it under various assignment agreements by these music labels. He has submitted that PPL has Assignment agreements with 60% of the labels in its repertoire whereby the following rights have been assigned exclusively to PPL. These Agreements can be found on the official website of PPL. Further, he has submitted that with respect to 11 labels, PPL is the 'Exclusive Licensee' of the copyright in the sound recordings. Barring these 11 labels, for all the other labels i.e. 393 of 404, PPL has Assignment Deeds executed for the copyright in the sound recordings.","96. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that after noticing the problems with the activities of copyright societies introduced by the 1994 Amendment, the Act was further amended in 2012 to incorporate additional provisions for regulation of copyright societies. Elaborate rules were also framed under Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013. He has placed reliance upon the provisions of the Copyright Act and Rules that regulate the business of granting license. He has submitted that it is evident that the Chapter VII of Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules put in place an elaborate regime to regulate the business of issuing licenses. The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the 2012 Amendment also notes that one of the objects for the amendment was to ""make provision for formulation of a tariff scheme by the copyright varsha 55 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies subject to scrutiny by the Copyright Board"". He has also placed reliance upon the 227th Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee dated November 2010 on the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2010 that ultimately led to the 2012 Amendments to the Copyright Act. He has submitted that reference to the above material is appropriate and necessary to ascertain the legislative intent behind Chapter VII of the Copyright Act. Such reference to legislative history has been approved by the Supreme Court in ""R. S. Nayak vs. A. R. Antulay"" 26 wherein it was held that the function of the court is to give effect to the real intention of Parliament. These materials are permissible aids to construction and their denial would deprive the court of substantial and illuminating aid to construction.
",,,,
,,,,"29. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Godavat Pan Masala Products I.P. Ltd. vs. Union of India"" 5. The Supreme Court has held as under:

""It is an accepted Canon of Construction of Statutes that a statute must be read as a whole and one 5(2004) 7 SCC 
                   provision of the Act should be construed with
reference to other provisions of the same act so as to make a consistent, harmonious enactment of the whole statute. The Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the Clauses to be construed but to the Scheme of the entire statute. The attempt must be to eliminate conflict and to harmonize the different parts of the statute for. It cannot be assumed that Parliament had given by one hand what it took away by the other. (emphasis supplied).
The same principle has been enunciated by the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's (Supra).",,"67. Mr. Kadam has submitted that if the argument of the Defendants that the 'business' of licensing can be conducted only through a copyright society is to be accepted then, it would only be the Copyright Society who would be in a position to maintain a suit for infringement. The Defendants' have failed to address the issue that no conditions have been introduced in Section 51 and Section 19 for exercise of rights by the Copyright Owner at the time when the Copyright Society chapter was introduced in the Act. He has accordingly submitted that the PPL in the present case has exercised its rights as an owner and is not administering the rights of others. This has been overlooked by the Defendants in their arguments. He has accordingly submitted that PPL by exercising its rights as owner is able to seek reliefs as sought for in the above suits.","100. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the law clearly seeks to address a mischief, i.e., of a person carrying on the business of varsha 57 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc licensing without regulation. He has submitted that the statute must be interpreted to avoid this mischief by following the Heydon's Rule or mischief rule. He has referred to the following cases on this point:

a. The Supreme Court in ""Godawat Pan Masala Products (I) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors"" 28 it was held that for construing a statute, all sections will have to be read together to ascertain what is the mischief sought to be avoided.",,,,
,,,,"30. Mr. Khambata has submitted that applying these principles, the only interpretation and the way to look at the term 'business' that harmonizes Section 33 with the other sections in the Act would be to construe business as ""business of trading or granting licenses in respect of works which are not owned by such person"" as held by this Court in ""Leopold Cafe"" (Supra). The meaning of ""business"" has to be necessarily such that would not cause violence to other provisions of the Act including Sections 18, 19, 30 and 34.",,"68. Dr. Virendra Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendants in the above suits has submitted that the prohibition imposed by Section 33(1) applies if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) Plaintiff is a "" person or association of persons""; and (ii) Plaintiff carries on business of issuing or granting licenses. He has submitted that both PPL and Novex in the above suits are limited companies and therefore, fall within the meaning of ""persons"". He has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Section 33(1) to suggest that the word ""persons"" excludes owners of copyright. On the contrary, ""persons"" as used in Section 33(1) must include owners because Section 33(1) refers to issuing of licenses. Admittedly, only an owner can issue a license under Section 30 of the Act.","109. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not exempt PPL and Novex from the prohibition of Section 33(1). Apart from claiming to be owners, PPL and Novex have not satisfied the conditions of the Proviso viz. (i) Person is an varsha 61 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner of Copyright; ii) Person is acting in his 'individual capacity';
",,,,
,,,,"32. Mr. Khambata has referred to the definition of Copyright under Rule 2 (c)of the Copyright Rules, 2013. He has submitted that this definition is in wide terms although it also references sub-section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. He has submitted that definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules. It cannot be applied to interpret Section 31(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). He has submitted that if the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Section 30 and 33 of the Act.",,"84. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the clinching factor on this issue is PPL's antecedents. PPL was previously registered as a copyright society under Section 33 of the Copyright Act and admittedly carried on the business of issuing licenses. It applied for re-registration in 2013 but withdrew its application in 2014. It once again applied for re-registration in 2018, which was rejected by the Government on grounds of delay. PPL challenged this rejection before the Delhi High Court. The High Court directed the Government to consider PPL's application on merits. Vide order dated June 9, 2022, the Government rejected PPL's application on the ground that PPL ""has no professional competence to carry on its business and manage its affairs in accordance to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1957 and Copyright Rules, 2013 "". Pertinently, PPL has been carrying on exactly the same business of issuing licenses and collecting license fees. More importantly, the very fact that PPL was previously registered as a society and continued to fight for registration shows that PPL itself is aware that registration is required to carry on the business of licensing.","111. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that it is the contention of PPL and Novex that Section 33(1) is not a prohibition at all and that copyright facilities were merely a facility and option created for the benefit of owners. They have further contended that the 1994 Amendments to the Copyright Act introduced the concept of copyright societies for the first time as facility for owners by enacting Section 33(1). These contentions are plainly incorrect. He has submitted that copyright Societies existed long before the 1994 Amendment. In fact, PPL was founded in 1941 and has been 37 [(1976) 1 SCC 128] 38 [(2018) 14 SCC 161] varsha 62 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc carrying on the same business ever since. The facility of collective management was always available to owners even prior to 1994. Till 1994, there was no regulation on the business of licensing. Section 33(1) that was introduced by the 1994 Amendment brought copyright societies within the regulatory purview and mandated that the business of licensing should only be carried out through a registered entity. He has submitted that the material relied upon through the course of the hearing including the Supreme Court's decision in ""Entertainment Network"" 39, the Parliamentary Debates and extracts from Copinger make it amply clear that the object of copyright societies is not just to promote rights of owners but to balance it with public interest by protecting the interests of users.
",,,,
,,,,"33. Mr. Khambata has submitted that in any case, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.",,"125. Mr. Narula has submitted that the legislative intent to remove the basis of the Supreme Court Judgment in ""Indian Performing Rights Society vs. Eastern India Motion Pictures Association""40 and provide independent and non-assignable and non- waivable right of the authors can be best understood from four paragraphs of the Report of the Standing Committee, 227 th Report on Copyright ( Amendment) Bill, 2010. These are paragraphs 9.14 to 9.16 and 9.18 of the Report.","115. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no valid assignment in favour of the PPL and Novex and thus this cannot be the basis for a suit filed by the Plaintiffs in their capacity as assignees.
",,,,
,,,,35. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the contention of the Defendants that the later provision i.e. Section 33 would prevail over an earlier provision i.e. Section 30 of the Act has become obsolete in England. Even under Indian law the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's case (supra) made it clear that the rule is to be applied along with several other rules. The Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. It cannot be said that this last rule supersedes every other rule and the only thing that matters for harmonizing or resolving ambiguity is to see which is the latter provision as sought to be argued by the Defendant. The Supreme Court has also held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. If this test is applied the positive clear provision conferring statuary rights upon an owner to grant license is Section 30. Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.,,,"116. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the argument of PPL and Novex is that the second proviso to Section 33(1) uses the word 'business' and applies only to owners of underlying works. The consequence must be that owners of sound recordings such as PPL and Novex are entitled to carry on business without regulation.
",,,,
,,,,"36. Mr. Khambata has submitted that interpretation leading to unreasonable results must be eschewed. He has in this context placed reliance upon the decision of the UK Supreme Court in "" Gill v Donald Humberstone & Co. Ltd"".6 In the said decision the UK Supreme Court has elucidated the principle that if the language of a section is capable of more than one interpretation then, the Court should avoid natural meaning if it leads to an unreasonable result.",,,"117. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that this argument is highly flawed. He has submitted that the second proviso is of no relevance to the present matter as it only applies to underlying works incorporated in films or sound recordings. Sound recordings, that are the subject matter of the present dispute, are directly covered by the main enacting provision, i.e., Section 33(1) which refers to ""any work in which copyright subsists"". Thus, the prohibition against owners of sound recordings from carrying on business except through a copyright society can be found in the main section itself without any reference to the second proviso.
",,,,
,,,,"37. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants interpretation on 33 (1) must be eschewed as it will lead to absurd and unreasonable results. If such interpretation is accepted on withdrawal of authority by the owner from the registered copyright society (as is permissible under Section 34(1)(b)) no one will be able to license the work- not even the owner himself. The first proviso to Section 33(1) will place the owner who is a member of a copyright society in a better place (i.e. being able to license) then one who had never been a member at all (who could not, on the Defendants' interpretation, license its own work).",,,"121. Mr. Hiren Kamod and Mr. Amit Jamsandekar, amongst other Counsel have made submissions for the Defendants in their respective Suits which are in support of the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar, and in line with his submission.
",,,,
,,,,"38. Mr. Khambata has referred to the first Proviso to Section 33(1) which recognizes right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The only embargo in such a case is that the owner can grant a license consistent with its obligation qua such registered society. He submitted that what flows from the first proviso to Section 33 is that if as a member of a copyright society an owner can license his own works, 6[1963] 1 WLR 929 varsha 30 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works.
",,,"122. Mr. Rajiv Narula has made submissions on behalf of the Defendants in Commercial Notice of Motion No. 331 of 2019 in Commercial Suit No. 117 of 2019. He has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act including Section 33 and its Proviso. He has placed reliance upon the legislative debate which had also been relied upon by the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"". (supra). He has in particular has placed reliance upon Paragraph Nos. 38 to 40 and 42 of the said judgment. He has also referred to the 227 th Report on Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 2010 by the Parliamentary Committee.
",,,,
,,,,"48. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Madras High Court has in the said decision misconstrued the judgment of this Court in the case of Leopold (supra) and completely misapplied the ratio contained therein. The Madras High Court failed to appreciate that in Leopold (supra), Novex was merely an agent acting on behalf of undisclosed principle (which this Court held was prohibited by Section 33). The Madras High Court has conflated the first and the second proviso to Section 33(1) and applied its interpretation of the second proviso which deals with the authors of the underlying works to the first proviso which deals with assignees/ owners of the entire sound recording.",,,"127. Mr. Narula has submitted that the insertion of the definition ""copyright society"" and ""Chapter VIII-Copyright Society""

and the deleting the term ""performing rights society"" is reflected from 1992 Bill. This was in order to widen the scope of collective administration consistent with Clause 11 of the Bill 1992 Bill. He has referred to Clause 2 of the Notes on Clauses of the 1992 Bill in this context. Therefore, the copyright society was not only for the benefits of authors and owners, but also for the general public/users (like the defendants) for whom it is not convenient to obtain licenses.",,,,
,,,,"56. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance on the relevant definitions under the Copyright Act namely Section 2(d) which defines Author; Section 2(f) which defines Cinematograph film; Section 2(ff) which defines Communication to the public; Section 2(j) which defines Exclusive licence; Section 2(uu) which defines Producer; Section 2(xx) which defines sound recording; Section 2(y) which defines work and Section 2(ffd) which defines Copyright society. He has also referred to relevant provisions of the Act which includes Sections 13, 14, 17, 18 ,19, 30 and 33.",,,,,,,
,,,,"58. He has further referred to Section 61 of the Act which provides Owner of copyright to be party to the proceeding. He has submitted that in the present case, the infringement by failure to obtain license by the various Defendants is not only in relation to works of which the Plaintiff/PPL is an exclusive licensee but also in respect of works of which it is itself an varsha 39 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner. Thus and for that reason, Section 61(1) would not apply.",,,,,,,
,,,,"60. Mr. Kadam has submitted that upon reading of the aforementioned provisions of the Act, when an owner is monetizing copyright in any work, the owner is doing so for gain or for profit. Regardless of the scale at which such activity resulting in monetization of copyright takes place, it is a commercial or a business activity as it is being done for gain. Any restriction or curtailment of exercise of ownership rights whether by self- exploitation; assignment; license, depending upon scale or motive/manner of exercise or regularity of exercise of such ownership rights would be reading into the Act facets or nuances relating to the primary right of ownership of a copyright, which the Act does not in its language provide for at all.",,,,,,,
,,,,"61. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance upon provisions of the Bern Convention (1896), to which India is a signatory and particularly Article 2 (6), which provides that the protection of works mentioned in this Article shall shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title. Article 5 (1), which provides varsha 40 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc that Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention. Further, under Article 5(2) it is provided that, the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Further Article 9, which is Right of Reproduction, provides that Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. It shall be a matter for the legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.",,,,,,,
,,,,"63. Mr. Kadam, has supported the submissions of Mr. Kambata as to the interpretation of Chapter VII of the Act brought by the 1994 as varsha 41 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc well as 2012 Amendments, by which the second proviso to Section 33(1) was added. He has submitted that the embargo or prohibition on a person or association of persons commencing or carrying on the business of issuing or granting licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists other than by registering such association of persons as a copyright society [Section 33(1) r/w Section 33(3)] has no application to the issuing or granting of licenses in respect of any work by an owner or by an exclusive licensee who by the terms of the exclusive license is entitled to issue further licenses in respect of the work. This interpretation is supported by the provisions of the Act pertaining to ownership analysed. It is also in consonance with the first proviso to Section 33(1). This proviso clarifies that an owner of copyright shall in his individual capacity, continue to have the right to grant licenses in respect of his own works.",,,,,,,
,,,,64. Mr. Kadam has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Chapter VII or the relevant rules appearing in Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013 that mandates or forces owners who may in a given case own copyright in a large repertoire of sound recordings to become members of a registered copyright society. He has also placed reliance in this context on Section 34(1)(b) of the Act.,,,,,,,
,,,,65. Mr. Kadam has further submitted that the expression in his individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33 has nothing to do with whether the owner of copyright in a sound recording is granting licenses on a small or large scale so as to constitute such activity as a business. The expression 'capacity' when used in the varsha 42 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc context of a particular status applies where a person enjoys two statuses simultaneously. He has supported this interpretation placed by Mr. Khambata on the first proviso to Section 33 (1) in this context.,,,,,,,
,,,,"66. Mr. Kadam has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"" (supra) has overlooked Section 30 which only speaks of the owner's rights to license and does not talk about any capacity or does not talk about whether the activity is done at an individual level or as a business. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has completely lost sight of the phrase individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33(1), applies in the context of that proviso where the owner of a copyright in a work becomes a member of a Registered Copyright Society for that category of works. This subjectivity of 'individual capacity' transcending into the realm of business is a notion introduced by the judgment and brings about a whole world of uncertainty and ambiguity in the application of the provisions of the Act in paragraph 55. Further, the Madras High Court has concluded that the entity like the plaintiff therein which is involved in the business of issuing licenses falls within the net of the second proviso of Section 33 (1). There is no reasoning as to how the granting of licenses in respect of sound recordings which is not covered by the second proviso of Section 33(1) would take the activity of the Plaintiff within that second proviso.",,,,,,,
,,,,"69. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that since there is no ambiguity in the language of the section, the first rule of statutory interpretation, i.e., of literal interpretation, would demand that the word ""persons"" be given its natural grammatical meaning without any artificial limitations or restrictions.",,,,,,,
,,,,"70. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) prohibits ""any person or association of persons"" from carrying on the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"" without registration as a copyright society. PPL and Novex as aforementioned are covered by Section 33(1) as they are clearly ""persons"" as well as carry on a commercial activity that qualifies as ""business"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"71. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 30 and Section 33(1) operate in separate fields and do not conflict which each other. While Section 30 deals with the general right of an owner to grant a license, Section 33(1) regulates the business of licensing. The law is plain and clear - an owner has the right to issue a license. When his licensing activity enters the realm of ""business"", he is subject to statutory regulation under Chapter VII and must carry on his activities either by seeking registration as a copyright society or by doing it through a registered copyright society. Assuming without admitting there is a conflict, even then Section 33(1) is a special provision and must prevail over the general one. Moreover, the object of copyright law and legislative intent behind Chapter VII is to balance the rights of owners and public interest by varsha 45 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc protecting the rights of users. This would mean owners too are covered by Section 33(1).",,,,,,,
,,,,"72. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not efface or make Section 30 redundant. An owner's right to monetise his copyright through licensing is not taken away at all, it is merely regulated by Section 33(1). Such regulation is perfectly permissible when done by way of statute. In fact, Section 34(3) expressly preserves the right of licensing available under Section 30.",,,,,,,
,,,,"73. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not come to the aid of PPL and Novex because (I) it applies only to members of a Copyright Society; (ii) Assuming the First Proviso applies to non members, even then PPL and Novex are not covered as they do not issue licenses in their ""individual capacity"" or in respect of their ""own works"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"75. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) has no relevance to the present matter. It was brought in by way of amendment in 2012 to correspond to the changes made to Section 18 to protect owners of underlying works. It does not impact Section 33(1), which has been on the statute books since 1994.",,,,,,,
,,,,"76. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Division Bench of this Court in PPL vs. Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.10, disposed off the appeals against a set of ad-interim orders by clarifying that the Defendant may raise ""appropriate contentions including raising the issue of maintainability of the Suits at the instance of the present Plaintiff.""",,,,,,,
,,,,"78. Mr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that all the ad-interim orders obtained by PPL and Novex in the matters under consideration were limited to directing the Defendants to deposit the license fees in court if they wanted to play the sound recordings or directing the Defendants to take a license from PPL and Novex on a without prejudice basis. Neither did PPL/Novex seek nor did the Court grant them an injunction simplicitor.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"79. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument of PPL and Novex runs contrary to the well-settled principle of ex turpi causa non oritur actio or ex dolo malo non oritur actio i.e., a Plaintiff cannot find his cause of action on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law. This principle finds its modern origins in the classic passage of Lord Mansfield C.J. in the 1775 case of Holman vs. Johnson: He has submitted that this passage has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court and High Courts in several cases where the plaintiff's cause of action emanated out of an illegal act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"80. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Narayanamma & Anr. Vs. Govindappa & Ors"".11 has recently reviewed the entire law on ex turpi causa, including Lord Mansfield's seminal passage, and reiterated that if the plaintiff's cause of action 11 [(2019) 19 SCC 42] varsha 48 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc is based on an illegality, it will not grant any relief to the plaintiff, even if the defendant is guilty.",,,,,,,
,,,,"81. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the decision relied upon by PPL and Novex namely the English Supreme Court's decision in ""Patel v Mirza""12 to counter the above does little to assist the Plaintiffs. The said decision actually supports the Defendants' case as it makes clear that ex turpi causa is indeed a valid defence and that courts must examine the underlying purpose of the prohibition and the public policy involved.",,,,,,,
,,,,"82. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Plaintiffs reliance on Gurumukh Singh v Amar Singh [(1991) 3 SCC 79] is also misplaced. The said case dealt with an allegation that the object of the contract was harmful to public policy. There was no contravention of any law involved. In the instant case, however, the Plaintiff's actions are in direct contravention of Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act. As per the law laid by the Supreme Court, it would be impermissible to grant relief to such a plaintiff.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"85. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that similar is the case with Novex namely that they carrying on business of issuing / granting licenses. This is apparent from Clauses 1, 4 and 11 of the Memorandum of Association of Novex which makes it clear that the varsha 50 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc main object of Novex is to carry on business of granting licenses. Further, Novex's Annual Report for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 which clearly shows that Novex's principal activity is granting public performance licenses. Further, Novex's website while referring to public performance rights states ""Novex is engaged in the business of giving public performance rights in sound recordings"". Further, a holistic reading of the purported Assignment Deed dated August 11, 2015 executed with Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. clearly shows that Novex is in fact engaged in the business of issuing licenses.",,,,,,,
,,,,"86. Dr. Tulzapurkar has thereafter, referred to the definition of ""copyright business"" in Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 namely ""business of issuing or granting licence in respect of any class of works in which copyright or any other right conferred by the Act subsists, and includes the functions referred to in sub-section (3) of section 34"". He has submitted that the legislature has consciously chosen to define this term widely and has not excluded the business of licensing carried out by owners.",,,,,,,

,,,,"88. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon ""S Mohan Lal v R Kondiah 20"" and ""P K Kesavan Nair v C K Babu Naidu 21"" to contend that the word ""business"" should be interpreted as per context. However, reference to these cases does not assist PPL and Novex in any manner. There is no justifiable reason given by PPL and Novex to discard the definition of 'business' in the Copyright Rules namely Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013. Further, PPL and Novex have not denied that they indeed carry on business. Their own documents as aforesaid clearly show that PPL and Novex are in the business of licensing.",,,,,,,
,,,,89. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have based their argument on an incorrect assumption that an assignment from the original owner takes them out of the regulatory ambit of 15 [AIR 1953 Mad 343] 16 [(1981) 2 SCC 693] 17 [(1999) 4 SCC 630] 18 [AIR 1965 SC 531] 19 [AIR 1967 SC 1066] 20 [(1979) 2 SCC 616] 21 [1953 SCC OnLine Mad 368] varsha 52 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Chapter VII of the Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules.,,,,,,,
,,,,"91. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is nothing to suggest that this ""contract"" or ""agreement"" referred to in Section 34 and Rule 54 excludes an agreement of assignment. The trigger for regulation is the nature of the activity, i.e., business of licensing, and not the mode of acquisition of the right to carry on such business.",,,,,,,
,,,,"92. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no conflict between Section 30 and Section 33(1). Alternatively, assuming without conceding there is any conflict, even then Section 33(1) would prevail over Section 30. Section 30 is a general provision that deals with an owner's general right to license his copyright. Section 33, on the other hand, is part of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act, which is a special provision and self-contained chapter that elaborately governs the business of granting and issuing licenses. Moreover, the present Section 33 is a latter provision that was brought in by way of an amendment in 1994. Thus, the legislature had notice of Section 30 when it enacted Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"93. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is well settled law that the general law must yield to the special law. The Supreme Court in a catena of cases has reiterated this well settled Latin maxim ""generalia specialibus non derogant"". In ""Commercial Tax Officer, Rajasthan vs. Binani Cements Ltd. & Anr."" 22, the Supreme Court exhaustively reviewed the judicial precedents on the subject and noted that this principle is applicable not only amongst two statutes but also finds utility in resolving a conflict between a general and specific provision of the same statute. Further, it is also an accepted principle of interpretation that in case of conflict between two provisions of the same statute, the latter provision will prevail over the former. See K.M. Nanavati vs The State of Bombay 23 and In Re: W. G. Ambekar24. He has further submitted that both above principles are squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and would mandate that Section 33(1) must prevail over Section 30.",,,,,,,
,,,,"94. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is now well accepted that copyright law is not designed for protecting the interest of owners alone. It is intended to balance the rights of the owners with the rights of end users. He has placed reliance upon Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where this principle finds its origins. This is also noted by P. Narayanan in Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs 4th Edition where Article 27 is reproduced. Further, ""Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright"" 25 22 [(2014) 8 SCC 319] 23 [AIR 1961 SC 112] 24 [MANU/MH/0148/1952] 25 (15th Edition) varsha 54 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc explains the rationale for copyright societies (also known as collecting societies). The author notes that collecting societies benefit rights owners and users alike, and in principle operates for the benefit of the public.",,,,,,,
,,,,"95. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that India is not alone in regulating the business of collective administration of copyright. Among common law countries, the UK has adopted the 'Collective Management of Copyright (EU Directive) Regulations 2016.' Singapore too has an entire chapter on the subject in Part 9 of its Copyright Act, 2021. Thus, given the strong public interest involved in the collective administration of copyrights, governmental regulation of such business is commonplace across jurisdictions.",,,,,,,
,,,,"97. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. vs. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"". 27 wherein the Supreme Court has noted that the provisions of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act serve the dual objective of having copyright societies, i.e., to maintain a balance between the protection of owners' rights and interest of the public to have access to the works.",,,,,,,
,,,,"98. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the expansive words of Section 33(1), i.e., ""no person or association of persons shall commence or carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses""

clearly underline the intention of the legislature that business of 26 [(1984) 2 SCC 183] 27 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 56 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc issuing licenses can only be undertaken by a registered copyright society. These words are required to be construed in the context of its use in the Copyright Act and Rules which require that: (i) such business can be carried on only by a registered copyright society; (ii) such society is regulated by the Government; and (iii) there is only one society for one category of work. Thus, allowing PPL to carry on the business of licensing without registration would result in escaping the intended regulation and would be contrary to the scheme and object of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"99. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that if the Plaintiff's argument is accepted and an assignee/owner is permitted to carry on the business of issuing licenses without registration, then Section 33 itself would be rendered redundant and nugatory. This would be contrary to the clear intention of the legislature to regulate the business of licensing, even if the business is carried out by an assignee/owner. Since only an owner (which term includes an assignee) can issue licenses, it is quite obvious that the intent of Section 33(1) was to regulate owners of copyright who can potentially carry on the business of licensing. Thus, there is no logical basis in the Plaintiffs' argument that Section 33(1) applies to persons other than owners. He has submitted that the law intends that there must be a single copyright society for one class of work to ensure a single window for end-users.",,,,,,,
,,,,"100. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the law clearly seeks to address a mischief, i.e., of a person carrying on the business of varsha 57 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc licensing without regulation. He has submitted that the statute must be interpreted to avoid this mischief by following the Heydon's Rule or mischief rule. He has referred to the following cases on this point:

a. The Supreme Court in ""Godawat Pan Masala Products (I) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors"" 28 it was held that for construing a statute, all sections will have to be read together to ascertain what is the mischief sought to be avoided.
b. In ""Ameer Trading Corporation Ltd. vs. Shapoorji Data Processing Ltd"".29 the Supreme Court reiterated that the Heydon's Rule or Mischief Rule must be applied to suppress the mischief that was intended to be remedied, especially when Parliament has consciously made an amendment to the law.

c. In ""S. Mohan Lal vs. R. Kondiah"" 30 it was held that the expressions used in the Act must take their colour from the context in which they appear.

d. In ""Badshah vs. Urmila Badshah Godse""31 the Supreme Court relied on the Heydon Rule to hold that courts must avoid a construction that ""would reduce the legislation to futility and should accept the bolder construction based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing an effective result"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"101. In ""District Mining Officer vs. Tata Iron & Steel Co. & Anr.""32 the Supreme Court explained that legislation is primarily directed to the problems before the legislature and to cover similar problems arising in future. Thus, the legislative intent is to be derived by considering the words in the enactment "" in light of any discernable purpose or object which comprehends the mischief and its remedy to which the enactment is directed"".

",,,,,,,
,,,,"102. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Chapter VII of the Copyright Act requires that the business of licensing be carried on in a particular manner. The Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to circumvent the entire regulatory regime and carry on the business of licensing in a manner other than what is prescribed by law. This would go against the well accepted rule laid down in ""Taylor vs Taylor Taylor"" 33 that if the law requires something to be done in a particular manner, it must be done only in that manner or not at all. He has referred to the decision of the ""Nazir Ahmad vs. The King- Emperor"" 34 and State of ""Uttar Pradesh vs. Singhara Singh"" 35, which follows the Taylor Rule.",,,,,,,
,,,,"103. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the principles of construction propounded by PPL and Novex are misconceived and not applicable to instant case. He has submitted that the decisions relied upon by them in support of ""harmonious construction"" would 32 [(2001) 7 SCC 358] 33 [(1875) Vol.1Ch.D 426] 34 [1936 LXIII Indian Appeals 372] 35 [(1964) 4 SCR 485] varsha 59 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc require the court to read down Section 33(1) such that ""owners"" are excluded from the word ""persons"". This is contrary to the plain language used in Section 33(1) of the Act. Further, harmonious construction applies only if there is an ambiguity in the language of the statute and cannot be used if the language is clear. In the present case, the language of Section 33(1) is plain and unambiguous. Hence, it would be impermissible to ignore the rule of literal interpretation and apply the rule of ""harmonious construction""

instead.",,,,,,,
,,,,"104. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not take away the general rights of owners to license their works. On the contrary, it retains and preserves that right but only regulates the manner in which the business of licensing is to be carried on. Thus, all that Section 33(1) requires is that if an owner wishes to carry on the business of licensing, he must do it in the legally mandated manner, i.e., through a registered copyright society.",,,,,,,
,,,,"105. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon the decisions in ""Union of India vs. Dileep Kumar Singh""36 to contend that the court must give precedence to the leading provision over the subordinate provision. However, this case too is inapplicable in the present situation. PPL and Novex have been unable to explain how Section 30 is a leading provision and Section 33 is a subordinate provision. On the contrary, the two operate in separate fields altogether.",,,,,,,
,,,,"106. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon decisions in support of their contention that absurd or unintended results of interpretation should be avoided. In the instant case, there is no ambiguity in the language of Section 33(1). There is no absurdity or unintended consequence by adhering to the plain meaning of Section 33(1).",,,,,,,
,,,,"107. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that constant refrain of PPL and Novex was that giving literal interpretation to Section 33(1) would lead to ""effacement"" of Section 30 and take away the right of an owner to monetise his copyright is completely incorrect.",,,,,,,
,,,,"108. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33 does not take away an owner's right to license for commercial purposes. All that Section 33 postulates is that the business of licensing should be carried out in a regulated manner by registration under the Copyright Act. If an owner wishes to carry on business, he has to either be registered as a copyright society himself or must carry on the activity through a copyright society. Quite contrary to the Plaintiffs' submission, Section 33(1) would be effaced if the Plaintiffs' submissions are accepted. Since only an owner can issue licenses, exclusion of an owner from its purview would render Section 33(1) completely meaningless and redundant.",,,,,,,
,,,,"110. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Dwarka Prasad vs. Dwarkadas Saraf"" 37 wherein it is held that a proviso does not travel beyond the main provision. Further, in ""Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited vs. Tarun Pal Singh and Ors"" 38 the Supreme Court went on to explain that a proviso cannot be interpreted as stating a general rule. He has submitted that there is nothing exceptional in the language or scheme of Section 33(1) or the first proviso to suggest that the proviso warrants a deviation from the general rule of interpretation. It cannot therefore be construed as creating an independent right in favour of the Plaintiff beyond the main enacting section.",,,,,,,
,,,,"112. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that copyright societies are ""agencies"" or administrators of rights does not take that case any further. The decision of the Supreme Court's in ""Entertainment Network and Delhi High Court's decision in Lizard Lounge"" (Supra) relied upon by PPL and Novex in this context deal with the question whether business of licensing can be carried out by an owner without registration. Further, Section 33 requires a particular activity, i.e., business of licensing, to be done only by regulated entity/through a regulated entity.",,,,,,,
,,,,"113. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that the authorization granted to a copyright society can be withdrawn by an owner under Section 34(1)(b) would suggest that it is not mandatory for an owner to carry on business only 39 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 63 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc through a society ought to be rejected. All that Section 34(1)(b) says is that an owner is not perpetually bound to be a member of a copyright society and the section enables him to withdraw from a collective management system should he choose to. This is a voluntary act. Once he withdraws, he is in the same position as any other person who is not a member of a copyright society. He can exercise all rights under Section 14 and also issue a license under Section 30 in an individual capacity. But he cannot carry on the business of licensing. If he wishes to recommence the business of licensing, he has to once again join a registered copyright society.",,,,,,,
,,,,"114. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument canvassed by PPL and Novex was that Section 31 provides for compulsory licensing. Thus, there is no need to regulate owners who carry on the business of licensing by requiring them to register as copyright societies is wholly fallacious and an incorrect reading of Section 31. Compulsory licensing is a completely different concept from regulation of the business of licensing carried on by copyright societies. He has submitted that Section 31 (1) (a) does not allow a user to challenge a Tarriff Scheme, whereas under Section 33 A this is allowed to a user. Further under Section 31, compulsory license can only be granted to a person whom the board/court finds ""qualified"" to receive a license. There is no such restriction under Section 33A. A decision for compulsory licensing under Section 31 creates a right in rem only in favour of the complainant/prospective licensee. On the other hand, an appeal under Section 33A results in modification of the Tariff Scheme for the public at large. Merely varsha 64 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc because the Copyright Act provides two remedies for two different scenarios, it cannot mean that one of the remedies available in law should be given a complete go-by to.",,,,,,,
,,,,"118. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the main section 33(1) and the First Proviso have been in the statute since the 1994 varsha 65 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Amendments. The Second Proviso was brought in only in 2012. This is relevant because the 2012 Amendment Act also amended Section 18(1) and added provisos therein which prohibited authors of underlying works from assigning or waiving the right to receive royalties except to their legal heirs or copyright societies. Thus, it was necessary to make corresponding clarificatory changes to Section 33(1).",,,,,,,
,,,,"119. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications (P) Ltd. Vs DXC Technology (P) Ltd"". (Supra). He has submitted that the Madras High Court extensively considered all issues relating to Section 33 including the arguments raised by the Plaintiffs in the instant matter. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has correctly holds that Section 33 distinguishes between granting licenses in an individual capacity and carrying on the business of licensing. The Court holds that ""once the grant of license moves from the owner in his individual capacity and transcends into the realm of a business ""

Section 33(1) applies. On this basis, the Court concluded that since Novex was statutorily barred from issuing licenses, the very substratum for the relief sought by Novex must crumble like a pack of cards.",,,,,,,
,,,,"120. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that this Court be pleased to answer the aforementioned issue in favour of Defendants and dismiss the Plaintiffs' Interim Applications.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"123. Mr. Narula has submitted that in interpreting any statute, the role of the Court is to give effect to the will of the legislature. Where ambiguities exist, the Courts, no doubt, have the power to take recourse to external and internal aids to construe a provision in line with the intention of the legislature. Having examined the background leading to the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012, in view of Section 33(1) and its second proviso, the business of granting or issuing licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists, can be undertaken only through a copyright society registered under Section 33(3) of the Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"124. Mr. Narula has submitted that the second Proviso to Section 33(1) and proviso to Section 33 (3A), being the consequence and effect of the amendments to Section 17, 18 and 19 read with Section 30A, provides that the business of issuing or granting licence (being collection and distribution) of sound recording or cinematograph film, which comprises of the non- assignable and non-waivable rights in literary and musical work ""shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under this Act"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"130. Mr. Shenoy has submitted that Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act provides that no person or association of persons shall ""commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses"". It is necessary for this Court to give meaning to what is meant by the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"".He has submitted that these words are used by the Legislature to mean the ""Collective Administration of Copyright"". The same is borne out of the varsha 70 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc statement and objects and reasons of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1992 as well as Clause 11 of Notes on Clause. Further, the title/ heading of Chapter VII is ""Copyright Societies"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"132. Having considered the submissions, for determining the issue that arises in the above suits viz. whether the plaintiff is entitled to seek reliefs sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act, it would be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act. In the present case, that PPL and Novex have been partially assigned the copyright under the Sound Recording Agreements i.e. to communicate the sound recordings to the public.",,,,,,,
,,,,"133. Section 14 of the Act defines a copyright to mean the exclusive right to reproduce a literary, dramatic or musical work in any material form including storing by electronic means; to make copies of such a work; to perform it in public and in the case of a sound recording it includes the right to sell or give on commercial rentals or to communicate the sound recording to the public. Further, 'Owner' of Copyright is provided in Chapter IV of the Act. As submitted by Mr. Khambata, Ownership of copyright can be acquired in 4 broad ways including through an assignment under Sections 18 & 19 of the Act which is relevant in the present case. These confer varsha 71 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc full and absolute ownership on the author/owner/assignee, as the case may be.",,,,,,,
,,,,"134. Further Section 18(2) of the Act provides as under :

""where the assignee of a copyright becomes entitled to any right comprised in the copyright, the assignee as respects the rights so assigned, and the assignor as respects the rights not assigned, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner of copyright and the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"135. Whereas Section 18 (1) of the Act specifically recognizes the owner's right to assign his copyright either wholly or partially, to any person. This is a substantive right which has been provided to an owner under the Act and can be exercised without restrictions except as provided in the section.",,,,,,,
,,,,"136. Thus, in my view a partial assignment created as in the present case in favour of PPL and Novex i.e. to communicate sound recording to the public, to the extent of the right so created, the assignee is an 'owner' of the copyright in the work.",,,,,,,
,,,,"137. PPL and Novex as assignees/owners of copyright license their work under section 30 of the Act. This Section falls under Chapter VI of the Act and reads as under:

""30. Licences by owners of copyright.:-The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:
Provided that in the case of a licence relating to copyright in any future work, the licence shall take effect only when the work comes into existence.
Explanation.-- Where a person to whom a licence relating to copyright in any future work is granted under this section dies before the work comes into existence, his legal representatives shall, in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the licence, be entitled to the benefit of the licence"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"138. Thus, Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright who may be an assignee, the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers a ""duly authorized agent"" of the varsha 73 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner, to grant license. Thus, it follows that PPL and Novex as owners/assignees have the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license which would include the interest of communicating the sound recordings to the public.",,,,,,,
,,,,"139. Now turning to the scope and object of the 1994 Amendment which added Chapter VII and in particular sections 33 to 36 in the Act. Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses reads as follows:

""This clause seeks to substitute new provisions for Chapter VII to make provision for copyright societies in respect of any kind of right (and not merely ""performer's rights"") and to make adequate general provision for the registration and management of such societies in the interests both of authors and of other copyright owners for whom it would be impractical or uneconomical to licence the use of their work individually to all users,...""",,,,,,,
,,,,"140. Thus, from a reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses Sections 33 to 36 have been introduced as part of Chapter VII for promoting the collective administration of rights through copyright societies, both for the benefit of the owner as well as the general public. These societies, on an ""authorization"" from the varsha 74 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. A copyright Society fundamentally operates to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"141. In my view, by its very nature, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) as an authorized agent and (ii) as an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. It is necessary to note that under section 34 of the Act and in particular Section 34 (1) (b) it is provided that an owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This also shows that an author or other owner/assignee does not have to carry on the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights under Section 30 of the Act to grant licenses as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author/owner withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).",,,,,,,
,,,,"142. Thus it is clear that the 1994 Amendment which introduced these provisions was brought in to protect and facilitate varsha 75 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the exercise of ""owner's"" rights, not to restrict or diminish them in any way.",,,,,,,
,,,,"143. The other relevant provision namely Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent. Section 35(1) of the Act provides that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ..."". Thus, both Sections 34 and 35 draw a clear distinction between the author/ owner of the right on the one hand and the administrator of that right on the other (i.e. the copyright society).",,,,,,,
,,,,"144. The decision relied upon by Mr. Khambata on behalf of Novex namely ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"" (Supra) is apposite. The Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. The Supreme Court holds that as per the Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Paragraph 66 of the said decision reads as under:

""66. ...It may, however, be of some importance to note that Chapter VII deals with Copyright society, the concept whereof was incorporated in the Act so varsha 76 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property by a widespread dispersal in a regulated manner. It for all intent and purport steps into the shoes of the author. The society grants license on behalf of the author, it files litigation on his behalf, both for the purpose of enforcement as also protection of the enforcement of his right. It not only pays royalty to the author but is entitled to distribute the amount collected by it amongst its members. Section 34 providing for administration of rights of owners by a copyright society for all intent and purport creates a virtual agency so as to enable the society to act on behalf of the owner..."".",,,,,,,
,,,,"146. This is further made clear by Delhi High Court in ""Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs Lizard Lounge & Ors"". (supra) which has also been relied upon by Mr. Khambata on behalf of Novex. The Delhi High Court has held thus:

""the owner continues to simultaneously have rights to deal with his Copyright in the work...25.....The Copyright Society is an agent appointed under the agreement by the owner of the Copyright and specific powers have been conferred on the agent to institute legal proceedings. However, this does not denuding the author of its own individual rights"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"147. The function of a Copyright Society has been highlighted by Copinger at Page 1540 which has been relied upon by Mr. Khambata for Novex, wherein copyright society is referred to as a collecting society. Collecting societies provide a service to enable rights owners to enforce and administer certain of their copyrights effectively and cheaply, and secondly to provide a service to users by facilitating access to copyright works and making it possible for users to comply with their obligations under the law to obtain licences for the use of copyright works. Advantages of collecting societies has also been mentioned. Collecting societies are practically, economically and legally both viable and essential: Practically, because copyright owners cannot be in an indefinite number of places at the same time exercising individual rights. Further, ""collecting administration bodies provide the best available mechanism for licensing and administering copyrights and is to be encouraged wherever individual licensing is not practicable. They represent the best means of protecting the rights owners' interests"", enabling copyright owners to license and monitor the use of their works, to collect and distribute together and to bring varsha 78 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc actions for infringement. At the same time, they facilitate access to copyright protected works for the consumer and minimize the number of persons with whom users must negotiate licensing contracts.",,,,,,,
,,,,"148. I am of the considered view that Section 33 (1) of the Act cannot curtail the power of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license under Section 30 of the Act. This provision has not at all being denuded by the 1994 Amendment, which has brought in Chapter VII in the Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"149. I do not find any merit in the interpretation placed by the Defendant that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an ""owner"" of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. If such interpretation is accepted, Section 33(1) of the Act would take way the power of owner and / or the right of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license. This would emasculate right of the owner under Section 30. This was not contemplated by the Parliament by way of the 1994 Amendment Act. In my view, Chapter VII which deals with copyright society is operating in a different field than that of Chapter VI which is the source for granting of licenses by the owner of copyright.",,,,,,,
,,,,"150. It is a settled rule of Interpretation that two apparently conflicting provisions operating in two different fields should be reconciled by restricting each to its own object varsha 79 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc or subject. This has been expressly held by Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay"" 41. I find much merit in the interpretation placed by counsel on behalf of PPL and Novex that the prohibition as contemplated under Section 33(1) is on carrying on business of licensing by a person or association of persons in its own name for works in which ""others"". hold copyright. This has also held by this Court in Leopold Cafe and Stores and Anr. (supra). Thus in other words carry on ""business' of granting licenses can be authorised to an agent such as a copyright society under Section 30 read with Section 18, 19 and 34 of the Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"151. Further, the heading of Section 33 is ""Registration of copyright society"" and which could only mean that where a copyright society wants to carry on the business of issuing licenses on behalf of ""others"", then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33. This is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling in Chapter VI of the Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"152. The Interpretation placed on ""business"" in Section 33(1) of the Act by learned counsel on behalf of the Defendants by referring to Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 which defines 'Copyright Business' is in my view misconceived. This definition is in wide terms although it also references sub- section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. However, if 41 AIR 1961 SC 112 (Para 77(1)) (Sr. No. 41/ Page 737, Volume IV of Defendant's Compilation). the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Sections 30 and 33 of the Act. The definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules and it cannot be applied to interpret Section 33(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). Further, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"153. Much has been said by the counsel for the Defendants that Section 33 of the Act is a later provision and prevails over Section 30 of the Act. I find in ""K.M. Nanavati' (supra), the Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. Further, the Supreme Court has held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. I find that from the two provision viz. Sections 30 and 33(1) of the Act, Section 30 is the leading provision which is the source of power i.e. licensing rights conferred rights upon an owner . Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.",,,,,,,
,,,,"154. Although, there have been arguments on the First Proviso and Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act as well as reference to the legislation of 2012 Act as well as parliamentary debates and Speeches on this legislation, these provisos are inapplicable to the present case. The Second Proviso is confined to authors of underlying works which requires protection and thus inapplicable to the present case which concerns the owner of sound recordings. The Second Proviso to Section 33(1) in fact militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded on behalf of the Defendants. By amending section 33(1) in 2012 i.e. by adding the second proviso it would show that the Parliament itself did not contemplate that Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works. Thus, the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under the Act. Hence, it cannot be accepted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act is clarificatory.",,,,,,,
,,,,"155. The Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications vs DXC Technology Pvt Ltd"". (supra) has in my view overlooked Section 30 of the Act where the owner has a right to grant any interest in the copyright by way of license. The Madras High Court has applied the second proviso of section 33(1) of the Act to the right to communicate the sound recordings to the public, although such right does not fall within that proviso. The second varsha 82 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso as mentioned is confined to underlying works. Further, the Madras High Court has held that Novex is not entitled to issue licenses which according to the Court falls into the second proviso after considering legislative history and speeches in parliament. However, no reason has been provided as to how the licenses in respect of sound recording is covered by the second proviso to section 33(1).",,,,,,,
,,,,156. Thus in my view the Madras High Court has not considered Section 33(1) in light of other provisions of the Act namely Section 30 read with Section 18 and 30 of the Act which enables the Plaintiff- Novex as owner to grant licenses to the public.,,,,,,,
,,,,"157. In my considered view carrying on business of granting licences cannot be excluded from section 30 of the Act, particularly when such granting of licenses is by the owner of the copyright. The word ""business"" would include the grant of Licenses. If the interpretation of the Defendants on business is to be accepted then in that case 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy. Thus, this interpretation of the Defendant cannot be accepted.",,,,,,,
,,,,158. The decisions on business relied upon by the Counsel on both sides only support the above view.,,,,,,,
,,,,"159. The first proviso of Section 33(1) of the Act only recognizes the right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The first proviso has nothing to do with granting of Licenses by an owner of copyright under section 30 of the Act. If a member of the copyright society can grant license surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works. Thus, the first proviso to Section 33(1) cannot in any manner prevent a non member from exercising his rights under Section 30 of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"160. It appears from the argument of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that a distinction has been drawn between the granting of individual licenses by the owner and the carrying on of business of granting licenses by the owner which makes section 33 (1) applicable. I find no merit in this argument, particularly in view of aforementioned findings that Section 30 of the Act confers the power on the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license which in my view would encompass an owner carrying on business of granting licenses in respect of works in which he has copyright. Thus, there would be no fetter on the owners rights under Section 30 of the Act by Section 33(1) of the Act which falls under a separate chapter. Thus, in my view it is not necessary for PPL and Novex as owners/assignees of copyright to be registered as copyright societies for carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"161. Merely because PPL was at one time registered as a copyright society will make no difference to the above findings as PPL is granting Licenses as an owner and thus entitled under Section 30 of the Act to grant its interest in the copyright by license. Further, it will not make any difference that Novex is carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works as there is no restriction placed on an owner to grant any interest in the copyright by License. Thus, in my view the power under Section 30 to grant license by an owner has in no manner been denuded by section 33(1) of the Act. Accordingly, PPL and Novex as owners of copyright in respect of their works are entitled to file the present suits and seek reliefs sought for therein.",,,,,,,
,,,,"162. The above findings will also apply to those Suits where PPL and /or Novex are exclusive Licensees as Section 54 of the copyright Act, provides that an 'owner of copyright' includes an 'exclusive licensee'.",,,,,,,
,,,,"163. I further find no merit in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that the cause of action in the above suits is on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law as the plaintiffs have been generally assigned the business of granting licenses which activity they seek protection without having themselves registered as copyright society and thus violative of the statutory protection in Section 33(1) of the Act. The decisions relied upon on the well settled principle of of varsha 85 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc ex turpi causa non oritur actio or ex dolo malo non oritur actio are inapplicable in the present case. This is in view of my finding that PPL and Novex have the power as owners to grant interest in the copyright by license under section 30 of the Act irrespective of whether they are carrying on the business of granting licenses or not. Further, there is no bar under section 33(1) of the Act from an owner carrying on the business of licensing, or collecting license fees. Accordingly, I do not find that the Assignment Agreements and/or Exclusive License Agreements are illegal as contended on behalf of Defendants.",,,,,,,

6,"Gulraj Hotels Pvt Ltd vs Novex Communications Pvt Ltd on 24 January, 2024","1. In the above suits Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd and Phonographic Performance Ltd. (for short ""Novex and PPL"") respectively are the Plaintiffs. Identical relief has been sought in the above suits namely a perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant from publicly performing or in any manner communicating the sound recordings of the songs assigned and authorized to PPL and Novex respectively without obtaining licences from PPL and Novex.","2. A preliminary issue has been raised by the Defendants in the above suits namely that Novex and PPL cannot carry on the business of issuing licenses without being registered as a Copyright Society under Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act, 1957 (""the Act"") and thus, the Suit as filed will not entitle PPL and Novex to any kind of relief.","5. Mr. Darius Khambata, has made submissions with regard to the scheme of the Copyright Act, which is divided into various chapters and each chapter deals with a different topic. He has referred to the meaning of the term ""Copyright"" and the rights associated with it covered in Chapter III of the Act, under Section 14. This defines a copyright to mean the exclusive right to reproduce a literary, dramatic or musical work in any material form including storing by electronic varsha 14 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc means, to make copies of such a work to perform it in public and in the case of a sound recording it includes the right to sell or give on commercial rentals or to communicate the sound recording to the public. He has submitted that the rights of the owner of copyright and its associate rights are covered in Chapter IV of the Act. Ownership of the copyright can be acquired in 4 broad ways. These are as under:-

i) By the author himself, being the first owner under Section 17;
ii) Situations in which the author creates a work in the course of his employment etc. for the benefit or on behalf of someone else, also under Section 17;
iii) Through an assignment under Sections 18 and 19 and
iv)Through testamentary disposition under Section 20.",,"4. Mr. Darius Khambata, learned Senior Counsel has made submissions on behalf of Novex which are supported by the Counsel whose appearances have been mentioned above. Whereas Mr. Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel for PPL has made submissions on behalf of the PPL supported by the Counsel whose appearances are referred above.","6. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the aforementioned categories confer full and absolute ownership on the author/owner/assignee, as the case may be. Thus, the owner of the copyright could be an assignee. All the incidents of rights that are available to an owner are also available to an assignee. The rights are not higher or lower merely by virtue of the ownership rights being acquired through assignment. The Defendants termed the Plaintiffs as ""Aggregators"" whatever their characterization, in law, the Plaintiffs are as much owner as any other form of owner.","52. Mr. Khambata has submitted that when an owner takes an assignment of copyright, the object is to take ownership of the copyright. The consideration which prompted that is not the object or purpose of the contract. Analysis of the contracts entered into by Novex will show that the contracts have not even said anything about the assignment being taken for the purpose of business of granting license. Even assuming the contract did say that the contract was for the purpose of doing the business of granting license that would only describe the motive of the contract i.e. the reason Novex desired to take the assignment but that motive would still not be the object of the contract. Thus, Defendants' contention that if Novex has taken an assignment solely for the purpose of doing business, in licensing, then the assignment is for an unlawful object and therefore void, under Section 23 of the Contract Act, is misconceived.",,128. Mr. Narula has joined in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar that Novex and PPL have no right to maintain the present suits.,
,,,"3. Thus the issue which falls for determination prior to going into merits of each of the above suits, is whether PPL and Novex in the above suits are entitled to seek reliefs as sought for in the plaint without being registered as a Copyright Society under Section 33 (1) of the Act.","7. Mr. Khambata has referred to Section 18(2) of the Act wherein it is provided that the assignee shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner of copyright and the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly.
",,"12. Mr. Khambata has submitted that such a scheme provided under the Act would have been totally unnecessary if the Defendants were correct in their contention that it was only a ""registered copyright society"" which could carry on such business of issuing or granting licences. Accepting the Defendant's submission as pleaded and argued would amount to rendering this scheme meaningless.","13. Mr. Khambata, thereafter, referred to the Scope and object of the 1994 Amendment. By the 1994 Amendment a new chapter - Chapter VII was introduced, which deals with 'copyright society'. He has submitted that the object of 1994 Amendment was to promote the Collective administration of rights through a Copyright Society, both varsha 17 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc for the benefit of the owner as well as general public. The copyright societies, on an ""authorization"" from the owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. As such, a Copyright Society fundamentally operated to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"". He has submitted that by its very nature therefore, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) an authorized agent and (ii) an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. He has submitted that reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses together with Sections 33 to 36 which have been introduced by 1994 Amendment Act was was merely to provide for registration and to regulate functioning of copyright societies. The amendments so introduced did not in any manner affect and/or circumscribe the rights of an owner to conduct its own affairs including granting of licenses by such owner. The ""sea change"" as sought to be contended by the Defendants is absolutely not evident from the 1994 Amendment or Notes on Clauses in this regard.",59. Mr. Kadam has submitted that PPL's repertoire has a majority of works over which it is the owner. These are two compelling reasons and factors because of which the Court ought to exercise its discretion under Section 61(1) to hold that it is not necessary to make the 11 music labels who are Licensors/Owners of the works as party Defendants to the Suit.,,131. Mr. Shenoy has also joined in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar and other counsel for Defendants in submitting that the Plaintiffs have no right to maintain the present suit and that this Court dismiss the Plaintiffs Interim Application.,
,,,"51. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants' contentions are that the Assignment Agreements are illegal and erroneous. The Assignment Deeds have been executed for a substantial consideration between the music labels and Novex for transferring the 'on ground performance rights' in consonance with Section 18 of the Act. He has submitted that all that the Suit is concerned, is whether Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright and whether Novex has a right to prevent the infringement of its exclusive Copyright. Therefore, if it is held that Novex is the exclusive owner of the Copyright then what logically follows is that the Defendants have to be injuncted from infringing upon Novex's exclusive Copyright. This varsha 36 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc would be irrespective of whether or not there is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing Novex from carrying out the business of issuing licenses of its Copyrights.","8. Mr. Khambata has also referred to Section 18 (1) of the Act which specifically recognizes the owner's right to assign his copyright either wholly or partially, to any person.
",,"24. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Owner's right under Section 30 cannot be curtailed by Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that Defendants have alleged that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an owner of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. He has submitted that such an interpretation is ex facie incorrect because :

i) If the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendant is accepted, then Section 33(1) completely takes away the right granted by Section 30 of the Act. In such a case, Section 33(1) would effectively emasculate Section 30;
ii) Further, if Defendant's interpretation is accepted then a section in a chapter dealing with copyright varsha 24 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies would completely subordinate and emasculate the right of an owner under Section 30, a section which falls in a different Chapter dealing with licensing. If Parliament had intended to take away any part of the owner's right under Section 30 (even by subjecting it to the compulsory agency of a registered copyright society) then an express amendment to Section 30 would have been essential.","17. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent.","62. Mr. Kadam has submitted that in view of the aforementioned, the primary objective of copyright and provisions relating to copyright is being for the benefit and enjoyment and protection of the owner. He has also placed reliance on an extract from Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright Volume I, page 1503, Paragraphs 18-28 in this context.",,"164. Prima facie, I find that there is much merit in the submission on behalf of PPL and Novex that the above suits have been filed against the Defendants who are rank infringes as they have failed to obtain a license in respect of the works which they are exploiting. The present suits concern whether PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright and whether they have a right to prevent infringement of their exclusive copyright. This in my view would be irrespective of whether or not these is a bar under Section 33(1) of the Act preventing them from carrying on business of issuing licenses in respect of their copyright. In the event it is held that PPL and Novex are exclusive owners of the copyright then it would follow that the Defendants have to be prevented from infringing the copyright.",
,,,,"9. Mr. Khambata has referred to the Right of an owner of copyright to license its work under Chapter VI of the Act. Under section 30 of the Chapter VI of the Act the Licences by owners of copyright have been provided. The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:
",,28. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is also well settled that a statute is required to be harmoniously construed so that each provision is given effect to without defeating and/or destroying another.,"23. Mr. Khambata has referred to extract from Copinger and Skone James at Page 1540, wherein it is stated that the norm is that copyright licensing is done individually by the owners. It is only in situations where it becomes difficult or impossible for an owner to license his works individually that the need for Copyright Societies arises. The rationale for Copyright Societies is that it is the best means of protecting owners rights. Such Societies offer a facility to owners; they do not denude the owners of any of their rights.","126. Mr. Narula has thereafter referred to the Copyright (Second Amendment) Bill, 1992 introduced in Loksabha is on 16 th July 1992. He has in this context referred to the statement of objects and reasons and the Notes on Clauses appended to the 1992 Bill which clearly shows the intent of 1992 Bill. This was revised and modified by the Legislature before the enactment of the 1994 Amendment. He has submitted that it is important to note that Section 33(1) as proposed in the 1992 Bill did not contain the 1 st 40 [(1997) 2 SCC 820] varsha 68 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso to Section 33(1). The same was introduced subsequently. Therefore, it is obvious that the legislative intent initially was to impose a complete prohibition on any person or association to carry on the business of issuing or granting license except in accordance to the registration granted under Section 33(3) of the Act.",,"165. Accordingly, the issue as to whether PPL and Novex as Plaintiffs in the above suits are entitled to seek reliefs as varsha 86 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act is answered in the affirmative.",
,,,,"10. Mr. Khambata has submitted that Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Section 30 applies to an ""owner"". An ""owner"" as is clear from Section 18(2) and as mentioned above includes an ""assignee"". Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers ""duly authorized agent"" of the owner, to grant license. He has referred to Section 30 (A) of the Act and has submitted that this makes it very clear that the provisions of Section 30 apply to licensing in the same way as the provisions of Section 19 apply to an assignment. Therefore, the Act allows an ""owner"" to grant a license directly or through an agent under Section 30 and then sets out the varsha 16 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc procedure for licensing by specifying that what applies to assignment would apply to licensing as well.
",,"40. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the defendants have contended that the words 'individual capacity' in Section 33(1) is the opposite of business and therefore an owner licensing his works in his individual capacity would not be doing business as per Section 33(1) of the Act. He has submitted that this argument is also completely untenable since there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the words individual capacity is the opposite of business. He has submitted that a company can also do business in its individual capacity. He has submitted that the use of the expression ' carrying on business' must be interpreted contextually. The same would not cover the owners' activity of carrying on business and include carrying on business of issuing licenses in its own name but in which others hold copyright. Hence, the expression ""individual capacity"" in Section 33(1) must be interpreted as meaning only anything opposed to ""collective capacity""

i.e. through a society. That is collective administration of owner's rights.","27. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the word 'business' has no technical meaning but is to be read with reference to the object and context of the Act in which it occurs. The interpretation necessarily has to be ""contextual"". He has submitted that for this purpose it is 3 AIR 1961 SC 112 4Order dated 17th July 2014 in NOM (L) No.1451 of 2014 in Suit (L) No.603 of 2014; 2014 SCC OnLine Bom 1324.","129. Mr. P. Shenoy, learned counsel for the Defendant in Commercial Suit No. 37362 of 2022, has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapur and has relied upon the 'Mischief Rule' of Statutory Interpretation, which has also been highlighted by Mr. Khambata in his submissions on behalf of Novex. He has also referred to the functions associated with the business of ""Collective Administration of Copyright"" and has submitted that what PPL did when they were varsha 69 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc registered as a copyright society and what they continue to do today (when not registered as a Copyright Society), through the artifice of taking limited partial assignments, is the same. He has referred to ""Copinger and Skone James"" (supra) on Copyright, which articulates the difference between ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" and ""Collective Administration of Rights"". He has submitted that an ""Individual Exercise of Rights"" is where each rightholder of copyright enters into agreements with prospective users of his work without ""banding together"" with other rightholders. Moreover, when it comes to certain categories of copyright, individual right holders may ""band together to exercise rights on a Collective basis"" This would involve all the individual rightholders pooling in their individual works to create a common repertoire of works in a single entity, which repertoire is then provided to a prospective user through that single entity. Any entity which manages this repertoire of works pooled together by individual rightholders, whether through assignment of ownership, licensing or agency in common parlance is considered to be a ""collecting society"" or a ""licensing body"",",,,
,,,,"11. Mr. Khambata has referred to Sections 31, 31(A) to 31(D) of the Act which give a whole scheme of regulations for granting licenses compulsorily to the public. These sections fetter the right of the owner in the matter of grant of licences. He has submitted that the scheme of these sections contemplates notice to be issued to the ""owner"" to secure such licences thereby recognizing the primacy of the ""owner's right to licence"". The term owner is used in these sections not a ""registered copyright society"". These Sections of the Act envisage that it is the ""owner"" of the Copyright who is entitled to grant licenses for consideration and if he charges an exorbitant consideration, there is a remedy provided in the Act itself. It is the ""owner"" who is also entitled to be heard and to be paid.
",,"41. Mr. Khambata has thereafter referred to the second Proviso to Section 33 (1) of the Act. He has submitted that prior to 2012 Amendment by which the second proviso was added to Section 33(1), the authors of the underlying work lost their rights to their works to the owners of the sound recording or the owners of the cinematograph film who had employed them to create the underlying work. In order to correct this specific mischief a proviso was added to Section 17 as well as Section 18 as per the 2012 Amendment Act. These provisos stated that even if an individual who has authored a work has been employed by someone else i.e. the owner of the copyright, the authors' rights to the underlying work would not be affected by the ownership of the copyright by the employer. He has referred to Minister's speech tabling the 2012 Amendment and has submitted that the second proviso was introduced to assuage the grievances and/or concerns of the ""author"" community and this can also be culled out from the statement of objects and reasons to the said amendment.","31. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants have contended that ""business"" must be given the widest possible meaning and as such anything that is ""business"", including the grant of licenses varsha 27 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc by the owner is covered by Section 33 (1). He submitted that such a contention is completely counterproductive and in fact militates against the case of the Defendants. The wider the interpretation of the term ""business"", the greater the intrusion on the right available to the owner under Section 30. If business is interpreted as put forth by the Defendants, then in that case, 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy.","145. Thus, this decision of the Supreme Court makes it clear that Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner. It only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.",,,
,,,,"14. Mr. Khambata has submitted that it is necessary to refer in this context to Section 33 of Chapter VII of the Act, which is reproduced as under:-

Section 33 of the Act provides as follows;
""33. Registration of Copyright society.-- (1) No person or association of persons shall, after coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1994 (38 of 1994) commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licences in respect of any work in which varsha 18 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc copyright subsists or in respect of any other rights conferred by this Act except under or in accordance with the registration granted under sub-section (3):

He has also referred to the speech of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting whilst tabling this amendment, which is in this context. Further he has also referred to Parliamentary Committee 227th Report- 2011 Bill from which the discussion on the amendment to Section 33 can be ascertained. He has submitted that it is clear therefrom that the object of the amendment was to augment /strengthen the eco system with respect to the ""author"" community and ensuring equal representation of ""authors"" and ""composers"" on one hand, and ""owners"" on the other, in copyright societies.","34. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the different chapters in an Act cover different demarcated aspects. Chapter VII of the Act covers 'Copyright Societies' and further expounds on the conditions of varsha 28 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the registration and other associated aspects, whereas Chapter VI of the Act creates a statutory right of licensing. He has submitted that a section which comes under Chapter VII dealing with copyright societies cannot in effect, take away a right granted under a completely different chapter.

Mr. Khambata has submitted that what is significant to note in the 2nd proviso is that there is a complete embargo on carrying on the business of issuing or granting license in respect of the underlying work and this business can be carried out ""only"" through a copyright society. Therefore, it is clear that when the legislature specifically wanted rights of owners / authors to be curtailed, there was a specific, clear and unambiguous provision. This language is absent in Section 33(1). He further submitted that if the Defendants argument is accepted that Section 33(1) prevented all owners, including authors, from doing the business of granting license of copyright, then there would be no need of the second proviso.",39. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the first proviso to Section 33(1) uses the phrase 'individual capacity'. He has submitted that the term individual capacity should not be considered to be equivalent to exercise of rights by individual authors or owners personally. It should rather be understood to mean any method other than collective management whereby right holders make their own decisions about exercise of the rights in the works.,,,,
,,,,"(3) The Central Government may, having regard to the interests of the authors and other owners of rights under this Act, the interest and convenience of the public and in particular of the groups of persons who are most likely to seek licences in respect of the relevant rights and the ability and professional competence of the applicants, register such association of persons as a copyright society subject to such conditions as may be prescribed:

Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works. (3A)...
(4)...
(5)...",,44. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the second proviso was needed since the Parliament was clear that Section 33(1) did not prevent all owners including authors from licensing their copyrights for profit and since parliament wanted to draw distinction between the authors and the owners the second proviso became necessary. Hence it is specifically mentioned that licensing by the authors of the underlying works will only be done by the copyright society.,"49. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the argument of the Defendants is that the assignment is obtained by the plaintiff for the purpose of issuing and granting licenses and therefore cannot be enforced before this Court in view of Section 33(1). Since there is no varsha 35 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc bar in the Act in obtaining an assignment, at best and without prejudice to the argument elucidated above and, in the alternative, the bar would kick in only in respect of the actual grant or issuance of licenses. That will not affect the right of an owner independently to bring a suit for infringement of copyright and seek reliefs.",,,,
,,,,"15. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the heading of Section 34 is clear that it deals with 'Administration of rights of an owner by a copyright society'. Thus, it it is somebody else's rights which are being administered and that owner can be an author, employer, proprietor, an assignee or someone who inherits it. Therefore, the copyright society is acting in a capacity similar to a manager/agent while administering the rights of the owner.
",,"45. Mr. Khambata has submitted that if the second proviso to Section 33(1) is clarificatory (as argued by the Defendants), this would mean that the Parliament only wished to clarify this position for underlying works and not for any other works. Therefore even this case as canvassed by the Defendants militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded by them. He has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. varsha 33 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Commissioner of Central Excise"".7 at Paragraph 21 held that 'Parliament is deemed to know the law and therefore the fact that the Parliament has amended Section 33(1) in 2012 by adding the second proviso shows that Parliament itself did not think Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works'.","50. Mr. Khambata has submitted that another fact is that the Defendants have no independent right of its own. They are rank infringers. The Defendants have not even attempted to justify their entitlement in exploiting the subject sound recordings and has merely sought to assail Novex's entitlement to seek reliefs on the ground that Novex is not a registered copyright society. Once it is observed that the right to seek relief for infringement is not jeopardized, the relief as sought by Novex must follow. This is clear from a reading of Sections 13, 14 r/w. 51 (a)(i).",,,,
,,,,"16. Mr. Khambata has referred to Section 34(1)(a) which deals with the manner in which a copyright society would obtain varsha 20 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc authorization for administration which clearly conveys the intention to include both, the author and other owners of right which would include an 'assignee'. Further, Section 34(1)(b) of the Act contemplates that an author or other owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This shows that an author or other owner does not have to carry out the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).
",,"46. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Phonographic Performance Limited v. Avion Hospitality Pvt Ltd & Ors. has set aside the view taken by a Learned Single Judge of this Court in ""Phonographic Performance Ltd vs City Organisers Pvt. Ltd."".8 which had accepted the interpretation as sought to be canvassed by the Defendants. The Division Bench in ""Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd."" (supra) accepted the interpretation placed by counsel for the Plaintiff on Section 33 read with Section 34 of the Act and had found that the learned Judge's attention was not invited to several provisions of the Act from which it can be construed that the Plaintiff-Novex has locus to file the suit or claim injunction.","57. Mr. Kadam has submitted that one of the objections raised by the Defendant is that PPL cannot sue without joining the owner in respect of the exclusively licensed works. He has referred to Section 54 of the Act, which provides that unless the context otherwise requires, the expression ""owner of copyright""

shall include an ""exclusive licensee"". Further Section 55 provides that where the copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright shall be entitled to all such remedies including an injunction. From a reading of Section 55 with Section 54, an exclusive licensee would be entitled as an owner of copyright for the purposes of Chapter XII to institute a Suit and seek an injunction in relation to an infringement of copyright in any work covered by the exclusive license.",,,,
,,,,"18. Mr. Khambata has then referred to Section 35 (1) of the Act, wherein it is provided that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ...""
",,"47. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd."".9 does not assist the Defendant. He has submitted that the Madras High Court in the said decision has erroneously framed an issue whether Novex is entitled to grant licenses or not. The subject matter of the dispute before the Madras High Court was whether DXC Technology was infringing Novex's copyright or not, it wasn't whether 7[2016) 3 SCC page 643 8[Comm. Suit No. 740/2017 dated 21.12.2017 9[2021) SCC online MHC 6266 varsha 34 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Novex was entitled to grant licenses or not. He has submitted that the Madras High Court had relied heavily upon the reasons for introducing the 2012 amendment, in support of its decision. The Madras High Court held that a careful examination of Section 18, 30 and 33 show that while the right of the owner in his individual capacity is retained, the right to carry on the ""business of issuing and granting licenses"" is taken away on account of the bar contained in Section 33(1) read with the second proviso. The judgment also holds that the word ""only""","74. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the purported assignment agreements relied upon by the Plaintiffs are void and do not validly transfer actual ownership rights to the Plaintiffs as: (i) they do not identify the ""work"" as required under Section 19(2); (ii) they fall foul of the requirement to specify payment of royalty to authors; (iii) they do not confer actual ownership rights but are designed only to circumvent Section 33(1); and (iv) in case of PPL, there is no assignment/transfer of ownership in respect of 40% of the sound recordings.",,,,
,,,,"19. Thus, both Sections 34 and 35 draw a clear distinction between the author/ owner of the right on the one hand and the administrator of that right on the other (i.e. the copyright society) as such has been drawn.
",,"53. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the the Assignment Deeds are extremely specific and meet the requirements of Section 19. The Assignment Deeds categorically state that the ownership rights in the works are being assigned to Novex and there is no mention in the Assignment Deeds of the assignment being for the purpose of doing business in licensing. Therefore, the argument of the Defendants that the assignment is solely for the purpose of doing business in licensing must be rejected.","77. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have not filed a simpliciter suit for injunction on grounds of infringement. On the contrary, their entire case is that they are entitled to issue licenses and collect license fees. On this basis, they have sought a limited injunction against the Defendants from playing sound recordings without taking a license from the Plaintiffs. This is evident from the Plaintiffs' own pleadings. He has relied upon Paragraphs Nos. 6,9,11,13,28 and 32 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraphs Nos. 4, 6, 9 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by Plaintiff's advocate in respect of the alleged infringement at page no. 59 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023 and Paragraph no. 8 of Legal Notice dated October 4, 2022 issued by 10 Order dated 22nd December 2017 in Commercial Appeal (L) no. 100 of 2017.",,,,
,,,,"20. Mr. Khambata has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"".1 He has submitted that the Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. A Copyright Society steps into the shoes of the author, it issues licenses on behalf of the author and files litigation on his behalf. The Supreme Court goes on to hold that as per Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Therefore, Chapter VII does not take away the rights of the author/ owner, it only gives a choice to the author/ owner to either exploit its copyright on its own or to exploit its copyright through a Copyright Society. The idea of a Copyright Society is to assist the owner and not take away rights from an owner.

",,"54. Mr. Khambata has accordingly submitted that there is no question of there being any impediment in the Plaintiff's entitlement to the reliefs as sought. Equally, the fact that the Plaintiff is not a registered copyright society does not impair its ability to the reliefs as sought.","83. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL's and Novex's activities fall under Section 33 (1) of the Act and which is apparent from Clauses 3(a), 3(y), 3(z), 3(aa) and 3(ab) of its Memorandum of Association as well as 3.20 and 12 of its Articles of Association. This is also apparent from PPL's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022 which shows that its principal activity is granting 12 [(2016) UKSC 42] varsha 49 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc public performance licenses. Further, a holistic reading of the purported Assignment Deeds relied upon by PPL also points to the fact that PPL is in fact engaged in the business of issuing licenses.",,,,
,,,,"21. The Supreme Court has concluded that Section 34 of the Act provides for administration of rights of owners by a copyright 1 (2008) 13 SCC 30 Para 66 varsha 22 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc society for all intent and purport creates a virtual agency so as to enable the society to act on behalf of the owner...(emphasis supplied).
",,"55. Mr. Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the PPL has submitted that PPL owns and controls (by Exclusive Licenses) the public performance rights of various music labels which include both, international and domestic recordings. The repertoire of the recordings in which rights are assigned to PPL extend to around 400 labels and more than 45 lakh recordings. PPL issues licenses for public performances / communication to the public of sound recordings on the basis of exclusive rights assigned to it under various assignment agreements by these music labels. He has submitted that PPL has Assignment agreements with 60% of the labels in its repertoire whereby the following rights have been assigned exclusively to PPL. These Agreements can be found on the official website of PPL. Further, he has submitted that with respect to 11 labels, PPL is the 'Exclusive Licensee' of the copyright in the sound recordings. Barring these 11 labels, for all the other labels i.e. 393 of 404, PPL has Assignment Deeds executed for the copyright in the sound recordings.","90. Dr,. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the plain language of Section 33(1) does not exclude owners/assignees. There is nothing in the language to suggest that an assignment from an owner entitles an assignee to carry on the business of licensing to public at large without any regulatory fetters.",,,,
,,,,"22. Mr. Khambata has referred to the decision of the The Delhi High Court in the case of Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs Lizard Lounge & Ors.2 The Delhi High Court whilst discussing the role of Copyright Society and the rights that such Copyright Society can exercise observed that the author being the first owner of the Copyright under section 17 can certainly appoint an agent (Copyright Society) to institute legal proceedings. The Delhi High Court held that :-

""24....The Copyright Society may not have exclusive rights inasmuch as the owner continues to simultaneously have rights to deal with his Copyright in the work...
25.....The Copyright Society is an agent appointed under the agreement by the owner of the Copyright and specific powers have been conferred on the agent to institute legal proceedings. The said Act does not contain any provision prohibiting the institution of legal proceedings in derogation to the general law of agency. The author being the first owner of Copyright under Section 17 of the said Act can certainly appoint an agent to institute legal proceedings.

27. ...The creation of Copyright Society is to serve all the three objectives without denuding the author of its own individual rights"" (emphasis supplied)"".",,"67. Mr. Kadam has submitted that if the argument of the Defendants that the 'business' of licensing can be conducted only through a copyright society is to be accepted then, it would only be the Copyright Society who would be in a position to maintain a suit for infringement. The Defendants' have failed to address the issue that no conditions have been introduced in Section 51 and Section 19 for exercise of rights by the Copyright Owner at the time when the Copyright Society chapter was introduced in the Act. He has accordingly submitted that the PPL in the present case has exercised its rights as an owner and is not administering the rights of others. This has been overlooked by the Defendants in their arguments. He has accordingly submitted that PPL by exercising its rights as owner is able to seek reliefs as sought for in the above suits.","96. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that after noticing the problems with the activities of copyright societies introduced by the 1994 Amendment, the Act was further amended in 2012 to incorporate additional provisions for regulation of copyright societies. Elaborate rules were also framed under Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013. He has placed reliance upon the provisions of the Copyright Act and Rules that regulate the business of granting license. He has submitted that it is evident that the Chapter VII of Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules put in place an elaborate regime to regulate the business of issuing licenses. The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the 2012 Amendment also notes that one of the objects for the amendment was to ""make provision for formulation of a tariff scheme by the copyright varsha 55 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc societies subject to scrutiny by the Copyright Board"". He has also placed reliance upon the 227th Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee dated November 2010 on the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2010 that ultimately led to the 2012 Amendments to the Copyright Act. He has submitted that reference to the above material is appropriate and necessary to ascertain the legislative intent behind Chapter VII of the Copyright Act. Such reference to legislative history has been approved by the Supreme Court in ""R. S. Nayak vs. A. R. Antulay"" 26 wherein it was held that the function of the court is to give effect to the real intention of Parliament. These materials are permissible aids to construction and their denial would deprive the court of substantial and illuminating aid to construction.",,,,
,,,,"25. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ""K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay""3 recognizes the well settled rule of interpretation that two apparently conflicting provisions operating in two different fields should be reconciled, by restricting each to its own object or subject.
",,"68. Dr. Virendra Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendants in the above suits has submitted that the prohibition imposed by Section 33(1) applies if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) Plaintiff is a "" person or association of persons""; and (ii) Plaintiff carries on business of issuing or granting licenses. He has submitted that both PPL and Novex in the above suits are limited companies and therefore, fall within the meaning of ""persons"". He has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Section 33(1) to suggest that the word ""persons"" excludes owners of copyright. On the contrary, ""persons"" as used in Section 33(1) must include owners because Section 33(1) refers to issuing of licenses. Admittedly, only an owner can issue a license under Section 30 of the Act.","100. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the law clearly seeks to address a mischief, i.e., of a person carrying on the business of varsha 57 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc licensing without regulation. He has submitted that the statute must be interpreted to avoid this mischief by following the Heydon's Rule or mischief rule. He has referred to the following cases on this point:

a. The Supreme Court in ""Godawat Pan Masala Products (I) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors"" 28 it was held that for construing a statute, all sections will have to be read together to ascertain what is the mischief sought to be avoided.",,,,
,,,,"26. Mr. Khambata has then referred to the decision in the case of ""Leopold Café & Stores & Anr. Vs. Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd, 4 wherein the Supreme Court has held that the prohibition as contemplated under Section 33(1) is on conducting business of licensing by a person in its own name for works in which 'others' hold Copyright.
",,"84. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the clinching factor on this issue is PPL's antecedents. PPL was previously registered as a copyright society under Section 33 of the Copyright Act and admittedly carried on the business of issuing licenses. It applied for re-registration in 2013 but withdrew its application in 2014. It once again applied for re-registration in 2018, which was rejected by the Government on grounds of delay. PPL challenged this rejection before the Delhi High Court. The High Court directed the Government to consider PPL's application on merits. Vide order dated June 9, 2022, the Government rejected PPL's application on the ground that PPL ""has no professional competence to carry on its business and manage its affairs in accordance to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1957 and Copyright Rules, 2013 "". Pertinently, PPL has been carrying on exactly the same business of issuing licenses and collecting license fees. More importantly, the very fact that PPL was previously registered as a society and continued to fight for registration shows that PPL itself is aware that registration is required to carry on the business of licensing.","109. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not exempt PPL and Novex from the prohibition of Section 33(1). Apart from claiming to be owners, PPL and Novex have not satisfied the conditions of the Proviso viz. (i) Person is an varsha 61 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner of Copyright; ii) Person is acting in his 'individual capacity';",,,,
,,,,"necessary to note the heading of Section 33 which is ""Registration of copyright society"". He has submitted that the heading of a section can be used to interpret the object and purpose of a Section. It is well settled that the headings of sections are substantive parts of the act and limit or explain their operation. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati"" (supra) which is the authority for this proposition. He has also referred to the heading of Section 34 of the Act which is ""Administration of rights of owner by copyright society"". He has submitted that Sections 33 and 34 of the Act must be read as respectively restricted to the subject described by these headings. Therefore, if a copyright society wants to do the business of issuing licenses, then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33; this is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling under Chapter VI of the Act.
",,"125. Mr. Narula has submitted that the legislative intent to remove the basis of the Supreme Court Judgment in ""Indian Performing Rights Society vs. Eastern India Motion Pictures Association""40 and provide independent and non-assignable and non- waivable right of the authors can be best understood from four paragraphs of the Report of the Standing Committee, 227 th Report on Copyright ( Amendment) Bill, 2010. These are paragraphs 9.14 to 9.16 and 9.18 of the Report.","111. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that it is the contention of PPL and Novex that Section 33(1) is not a prohibition at all and that copyright facilities were merely a facility and option created for the benefit of owners. They have further contended that the 1994 Amendments to the Copyright Act introduced the concept of copyright societies for the first time as facility for owners by enacting Section 33(1). These contentions are plainly incorrect. He has submitted that copyright Societies existed long before the 1994 Amendment. In fact, PPL was founded in 1941 and has been 37 [(1976) 1 SCC 128] 38 [(2018) 14 SCC 161] varsha 62 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc carrying on the same business ever since. The facility of collective management was always available to owners even prior to 1994. Till 1994, there was no regulation on the business of licensing. Section 33(1) that was introduced by the 1994 Amendment brought copyright societies within the regulatory purview and mandated that the business of licensing should only be carried out through a registered entity. He has submitted that the material relied upon through the course of the hearing including the Supreme Court's decision in ""Entertainment Network"" 39, the Parliamentary Debates and extracts from Copinger make it amply clear that the object of copyright societies is not just to promote rights of owners but to balance it with public interest by protecting the interests of users.",,,,
,,,,"29. He has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Godavat Pan Masala Products I.P. Ltd. vs. Union of India"" 5. The Supreme Court has held as under:

""It is an accepted Canon of Construction of Statutes that a statute must be read as a whole and one 5(2004) 7 SCC 68 Para 29.

                   provision of the Act should be construed with
reference to other provisions of the same act so as to make a consistent, harmonious enactment of the whole statute. The Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the Clauses to be construed but to the Scheme of the entire statute. The attempt must be to eliminate conflict and to harmonize the different parts of the statute for. It cannot be assumed that Parliament had given by one hand what it took away by the other. (emphasis supplied).
The same principle has been enunciated by the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's (Supra).",,,115. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no valid assignment in favour of the PPL and Novex and thus this cannot be the basis for a suit filed by the Plaintiffs in their capacity as assignees.,,,,
,,,,"30. Mr. Khambata has submitted that applying these principles, the only interpretation and the way to look at the term 'business' that harmonizes Section 33 with the other sections in the Act would be to construe business as ""business of trading or granting licenses in respect of works which are not owned by such person"" as held by this Court in ""Leopold Cafe"" (Supra). The meaning of ""business"" has to be necessarily such that would not cause violence to other provisions of the Act including Sections 18, 19, 30 and 34.
",,,116. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the argument of PPL and Novex is that the second proviso to Section 33(1) uses the word 'business' and applies only to owners of underlying works. The consequence must be that owners of sound recordings such as PPL and Novex are entitled to carry on business without regulation.,,,,
,,,,"32. Mr. Khambata has referred to the definition of Copyright under Rule 2 (c)of the Copyright Rules, 2013. He has submitted that this definition is in wide terms although it also references sub-section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. He has submitted that definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules. It cannot be applied to interpret Section 31(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). He has submitted that if the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Section 30 and 33 of the Act.
",,,"117. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that this argument is highly flawed. He has submitted that the second proviso is of no relevance to the present matter as it only applies to underlying works incorporated in films or sound recordings. Sound recordings, that are the subject matter of the present dispute, are directly covered by the main enacting provision, i.e., Section 33(1) which refers to ""any work in which copyright subsists"". Thus, the prohibition against owners of sound recordings from carrying on business except through a copyright society can be found in the main section itself without any reference to the second proviso.",,,,
,,,,"33. Mr. Khambata has submitted that in any case, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.
",,,"121. Mr. Hiren Kamod and Mr. Amit Jamsandekar, amongst other Counsel have made submissions for the Defendants in their respective Suits which are in support of the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar, and in line with his submission.",,,,
,,,,"35. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the contention of the Defendants that the later provision i.e. Section 33 would prevail over an earlier provision i.e. Section 30 of the Act has become obsolete in England. Even under Indian law the Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati's case (supra) made it clear that the rule is to be applied along with several other rules. The Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. It cannot be said that this last rule supersedes every other rule and the only thing that matters for harmonizing or resolving ambiguity is to see which is the latter provision as sought to be argued by the Defendant. The Supreme Court has also held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. If this test is applied the positive clear provision conferring statuary rights upon an owner to grant license is Section 30. Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.

He has supported the submissions of Dr. Tulzapurkar on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act including Section 33 and its Proviso. He has placed reliance upon the legislative debate which had also been relied upon by the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"". (supra). He has in particular has placed reliance upon Paragraph Nos. 38 to 40 and 42 of the said judgment. He has also referred to the 227 th Report on Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 2010 by the Parliamentary Committee.",,,,
,,,,"36. Mr. Khambata has submitted that interpretation leading to unreasonable results must be eschewed. He has in this context placed reliance upon the decision of the UK Supreme Court in "" Gill v Donald Humberstone & Co. Ltd"".6 In the said decision the UK Supreme Court has elucidated the principle that if the language of a section is capable of more than one interpretation then, the Court should avoid natural meaning if it leads to an unreasonable result.
",,,"127. Mr. Narula has submitted that the insertion of the definition ""copyright society"" and ""Chapter VIII-Copyright Society""

and the deleting the term ""performing rights society"" is reflected from 1992 Bill. This was in order to widen the scope of collective administration consistent with Clause 11 of the Bill 1992 Bill. He has referred to Clause 2 of the Notes on Clauses of the 1992 Bill in this context. Therefore, the copyright society was not only for the benefits of authors and owners, but also for the general public/users (like the defendants) for whom it is not convenient to obtain licenses.",,,,
,,,,"37. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Defendants interpretation on 33 (1) must be eschewed as it will lead to absurd and unreasonable results. If such interpretation is accepted on withdrawal of authority by the owner from the registered copyright society (as is permissible under Section 34(1)(b)) no one will be able to license the work- not even the owner himself. The first proviso to Section 33(1) will place the owner who is a member of a copyright society in a better place (i.e. being able to license) then one who had never been a member at all (who could not, on the Defendants' interpretation, license its own work).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"38. Mr. Khambata has referred to the first Proviso to Section 33(1) which recognizes right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The only embargo in such a case is that the owner can grant a license consistent with its obligation qua such registered society. He submitted that what flows from the first proviso to Section 33 is that if as a member of a copyright society an owner can license his own works, 6[1963] 1 WLR 929 varsha 30 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"occurring in the second proviso can be done only through a registered copyright society.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"48. Mr. Khambata has submitted that the Madras High Court has in the said decision misconstrued the judgment of this Court in the case of Leopold (supra) and completely misapplied the ratio contained therein. The Madras High Court failed to appreciate that in Leopold (supra), Novex was merely an agent acting on behalf of undisclosed principle (which this Court held was prohibited by Section 33). The Madras High Court has conflated the first and the second proviso to Section 33(1) and applied its interpretation of the second proviso which deals with the authors of the underlying works to the first proviso which deals with assignees/ owners of the entire sound recording.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"56. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance on the relevant definitions under the Copyright Act namely Section 2(d) which defines Author; Section 2(f) which defines Cinematograph film;
",,,,,,,
,,,,"Section 2(ff) which defines Communication to the public; Section 2(j) which defines Exclusive licence; Section 2(uu) which defines Producer; Section 2(xx) which defines sound recording; Section 2(y) which defines work and Section 2(ffd) which defines Copyright society. He has also referred to relevant provisions of the Act which includes Sections 13, 14, 17, 18 ,19, 30 and 33.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"58. He has further referred to Section 61 of the Act which provides Owner of copyright to be party to the proceeding. He has submitted that in the present case, the infringement by failure to obtain license by the various Defendants is not only in relation to works of which the Plaintiff/PPL is an exclusive licensee but also in respect of works of which it is itself an varsha 39 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner. Thus and for that reason, Section 61(1) would not apply.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"60. Mr. Kadam has submitted that upon reading of the aforementioned provisions of the Act, when an owner is monetizing copyright in any work, the owner is doing so for gain or for profit. Regardless of the scale at which such activity resulting in monetization of copyright takes place, it is a commercial or a business activity as it is being done for gain. Any restriction or curtailment of exercise of ownership rights whether by self- exploitation; assignment; license, depending upon scale or motive/manner of exercise or regularity of exercise of such ownership rights would be reading into the Act facets or nuances relating to the primary right of ownership of a copyright, which the Act does not in its language provide for at all.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"61. Mr. Kadam has placed reliance upon provisions of the Bern Convention (1896), to which India is a signatory and particularly Article 2 (6), which provides that the protection of works mentioned in this Article shall shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title. Article 5 (1), which provides varsha 40 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc that Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention. Further, under Article 5(2) it is provided that, the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Further Article 9, which is Right of Reproduction, provides that Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. It shall be a matter for the legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"63. Mr. Kadam, has supported the submissions of Mr. Kambata as to the interpretation of Chapter VII of the Act brought by the 1994 as varsha 41 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc well as 2012 Amendments, by which the second proviso to Section 33(1) was added. He has submitted that the embargo or prohibition on a person or association of persons commencing or carrying on the business of issuing or granting licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists other than by registering such association of persons as a copyright society [Section 33(1) r/w Section 33(3)] has no application to the issuing or granting of licenses in respect of any work by an owner or by an exclusive licensee who by the terms of the exclusive license is entitled to issue further licenses in respect of the work. This interpretation is supported by the provisions of the Act pertaining to ownership analysed. It is also in consonance with the first proviso to Section 33(1). This proviso clarifies that an owner of copyright shall in his individual capacity, continue to have the right to grant licenses in respect of his own works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"64. Mr. Kadam has submitted that there is nothing in the language of Chapter VII or the relevant rules appearing in Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules 2013 that mandates or forces owners who may in a given case own copyright in a large repertoire of sound recordings to become members of a registered copyright society. He has also placed reliance in this context on Section 34(1)(b) of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"65. Mr. Kadam has further submitted that the expression in his individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33 has nothing to do with whether the owner of copyright in a sound recording is granting licenses on a small or large scale so as to constitute such activity as a business. The expression 'capacity' when used in the varsha 42 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc context of a particular status applies where a person enjoys two statuses simultaneously. He has supported this interpretation placed by Mr. Khambata on the first proviso to Section 33 (1) in this context.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"66. Mr. Kadam has submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DXC Technology Pvt. Ltd"" (supra) has overlooked Section 30 which only speaks of the owner's rights to license and does not talk about any capacity or does not talk about whether the activity is done at an individual level or as a business. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has completely lost sight of the phrase individual capacity appearing in the first proviso to Section 33(1), applies in the context of that proviso where the owner of a copyright in a work becomes a member of a Registered Copyright Society for that category of works. This subjectivity of 'individual capacity' transcending into the realm of business is a notion introduced by the judgment and brings about a whole world of uncertainty and ambiguity in the application of the provisions of the Act in paragraph 55. Further, the Madras High Court has concluded that the entity like the plaintiff therein which is involved in the business of issuing licenses falls within the net of the second proviso of Section 33 (1). There is no reasoning as to how the granting of licenses in respect of sound recordings which is not covered by the second proviso of Section 33(1) would take the activity of the Plaintiff within that second proviso.

,,,,"69. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that since there is no ambiguity in the language of the section, the first rule of statutory interpretation, i.e., of literal interpretation, would demand that the word ""persons"" be given its natural grammatical meaning without any artificial limitations or restrictions.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"70. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) prohibits ""any person or association of persons"" from carrying on the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"" without registration as a copyright society. PPL and Novex as aforementioned are covered by Section 33(1) as they are clearly ""persons"" as well as carry on a commercial activity that qualifies as ""business"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"71. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 30 and Section 33(1) operate in separate fields and do not conflict which each other. While Section 30 deals with the general right of an owner to grant a license, Section 33(1) regulates the business of licensing. The law is plain and clear - an owner has the right to issue a license. When his licensing activity enters the realm of ""business"", he is subject to statutory regulation under Chapter VII and must carry on his activities either by seeking registration as a copyright society or by doing it through a registered copyright society. Assuming without admitting there is a conflict, even then Section 33(1) is a special provision and must prevail over the general one. Moreover, the object of copyright law and legislative intent behind Chapter VII is to balance the rights of owners and public interest by varsha 45 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc protecting the rights of users. This would mean owners too are covered by Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"72. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not efface or make Section 30 redundant. An owner's right to monetise his copyright through licensing is not taken away at all, it is merely regulated by Section 33(1). Such regulation is perfectly permissible when done by way of statute. In fact, Section 34(3) expressly preserves the right of licensing available under Section 30.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"73. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the First Proviso to Section 33(1) does not come to the aid of PPL and Novex because (I) it applies only to members of a Copyright Society; (ii) Assuming the First Proviso applies to non members, even then PPL and Novex are not covered as they do not issue licenses in their ""individual capacity"" or in respect of their ""own works"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"75. Dr. Tulzapurkar has further submitted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) has no relevance to the present matter. It was brought in by way of amendment in 2012 to correspond to the changes made to Section 18 to protect owners of underlying works. It does not impact Section 33(1), which has been on the statute books since 1994.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"76. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Division Bench of this Court in PPL vs. Avion Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.10, disposed off the appeals against a set of ad-interim orders by clarifying that the Defendant may raise ""appropriate contentions including raising the issue of maintainability of the Suits at the instance of the present Plaintiff.""
",,,,,,,
,,,,"Plaintiff's advocate in respect of the alleged infringement at page no. 76 of the plaint in Suit No. 157 of 2023.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"78. Mr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that all the ad-interim orders obtained by PPL and Novex in the matters under consideration were limited to directing the Defendants to deposit the license fees in court if they wanted to play the sound recordings or directing the Defendants to take a license from PPL and Novex on a without prejudice basis. Neither did PPL/Novex seek nor did the Court grant them an injunction simplicitor.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"79. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument of PPL and Novex runs contrary to the well-settled principle of ex turpi causa non oritur actio or ex dolo malo non oritur actio i.e., a Plaintiff cannot find his cause of action on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law. This principle finds its modern origins in the classic passage of Lord Mansfield C.J. in the 1775 case of Holman vs. Johnson: He has submitted that this passage has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court and High Courts in several cases where the plaintiff's cause of action emanated out of an illegal act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"80. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Supreme Court in ""Narayanamma & Anr. Vs. Govindappa & Ors"".11 has recently reviewed the entire law on ex turpi causa, including Lord Mansfield's seminal passage, and reiterated that if the plaintiff's cause of action 11 [(2019) 19 SCC 42] varsha 48 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc is based on an illegality, it will not grant any relief to the plaintiff, even if the defendant is guilty.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"81. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the decision relied upon by PPL and Novex namely the English Supreme Court's decision in ""Patel v Mirza""12 to counter the above does little to assist the Plaintiffs. The said decision actually supports the Defendants' case as it makes clear that ex turpi causa is indeed a valid defence and that courts must examine the underlying purpose of the prohibition and the public policy involved.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"82. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the Plaintiffs reliance on Gurumukh Singh v Amar Singh [(1991) 3 SCC 79] is also misplaced. The said case dealt with an allegation that the object of the contract was harmful to public policy. There was no contravention of any law involved. In the instant case, however, the Plaintiff's actions are in direct contravention of Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act. As per the law laid by the Supreme Court, it would be impermissible to grant relief to such a plaintiff.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"85. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that similar is the case with Novex namely that they carrying on business of issuing / granting licenses. This is apparent from Clauses 1, 4 and 11 of the Memorandum of Association of Novex which makes it clear that the varsha 50 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc main object of Novex is to carry on business of granting licenses. Further, Novex's Annual Report for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 which clearly shows that Novex's principal activity is granting public performance licenses. Further, Novex's website while referring to public performance rights states ""Novex is engaged in the business of giving public performance rights in sound recordings"". Further, a holistic reading of the purported Assignment Deed dated August 11, 2015 executed with Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. clearly shows that Novex is in fact engaged in the business of issuing licenses.

",,,,,,,
,,,,"86. Dr. Tulzapurkar has thereafter, referred to the definition of ""copyright business"" in Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 namely ""business of issuing or granting licence in respect of any class of works in which copyright or any other right conferred by the Act subsists, and includes the functions referred to in sub-section (3) of section 34"". He has submitted that the legislature has consciously chosen to define this term widely and has not excluded the business of licensing carried out by owners.",,,,,,,
,,,,"87. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decisions of Courts on what is meant by ""business"" or ""carrying on business"", which are as under:-

i) 'Smith vs. Anderson' 13
ii) 'Bata Shoe Co. Ltd. vs. Union of India''14 13 [1879 Vol. XV Ch. Div. (CA) 247] 14 [AIR 1954 Bom. 129] varsha 51 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc

",,,,,,,
,,,,"vii) 'State of Gujarat vs. M/s. Raipur Manufacturing Co. Ltd.' 19.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"88. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon ""S Mohan Lal v R Kondiah 20"" and ""P K Kesavan Nair v C K Babu Naidu 21"" to contend that the word ""business"" should be interpreted as per context. However, reference to these cases does not assist PPL and Novex in any manner. There is no justifiable reason given by PPL and Novex to discard the definition of 'business' in the Copyright Rules namely Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013. Further, PPL and Novex have not denied that they indeed carry on business. Their own documents as aforesaid clearly show that PPL and Novex are in the business of licensing.",,,,,,,
,,,,"89. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have based their argument on an incorrect assumption that an assignment from the original owner takes them out of the regulatory ambit of 15 [AIR 1953 Mad 343] 16 [(1981) 2 SCC 693] 17 [(1999) 4 SCC 630] 18 [AIR 1965 SC 531] 19 [AIR 1967 SC 1066] 20 [(1979) 2 SCC 616] 21 [1953 SCC OnLine Mad 368] varsha 52 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Chapter VII of the Copyright Act and Chapter XI of the Copyright Rules.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"91. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is nothing to suggest that this ""contract"" or ""agreement"" referred to in Section 34 and Rule 54 excludes an agreement of assignment. The trigger for regulation is the nature of the activity, i.e., business of licensing, and not the mode of acquisition of the right to carry on such business.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"92. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that there is no conflict between Section 30 and Section 33(1). Alternatively, assuming without conceding there is any conflict, even then Section 33(1) would prevail over Section 30. Section 30 is a general provision that deals with an owner's general right to license his copyright. Section 33, on the other hand, is part of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act, which is a special provision and self-contained chapter that elaborately governs the business of granting and issuing licenses. Moreover, the present Section 33 is a latter provision that was brought in by way of an amendment in 1994. Thus, the legislature had notice of Section 30 when it enacted Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"93. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is well settled law that the general law must yield to the special law. The Supreme Court in a catena of cases has reiterated this well settled Latin maxim ""generalia specialibus non derogant"". In ""Commercial Tax Officer, Rajasthan vs. Binani Cements Ltd. & Anr."" 22, the Supreme Court exhaustively reviewed the judicial precedents on the subject and noted that this principle is applicable not only amongst two statutes but also finds utility in resolving a conflict between a general and specific provision of the same statute. Further, it is also an accepted principle of interpretation that in case of conflict between two provisions of the same statute, the latter provision will prevail over the former. See K.M. Nanavati vs The State of Bombay 23 and In Re: W. G. Ambekar24. He has further submitted that both above principles are squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and would mandate that Section 33(1) must prevail over Section 30.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"94. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that it is now well accepted that copyright law is not designed for protecting the interest of owners alone. It is intended to balance the rights of the owners with the rights of end users. He has placed reliance upon Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where this principle finds its origins. This is also noted by P. Narayanan in Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs 4th Edition where Article 27 is reproduced. Further, ""Copinger and Skone & James on Copyright"" 25 22 [(2014) 8 SCC 319] 23 [AIR 1961 SC 112] 24 [MANU/MH/0148/1952] 25 (15th Edition) varsha 54 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc explains the rationale for copyright societies (also known as collecting societies). The author notes that collecting societies benefit rights owners and users alike, and in principle operates for the benefit of the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"95. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that India is not alone in regulating the business of collective administration of copyright. Among common law countries, the UK has adopted the 'Collective Management of Copyright (EU Directive) Regulations 2016.' Singapore too has an entire chapter on the subject in Part 9 of its Copyright Act, 2021. Thus, given the strong public interest involved in the collective administration of copyrights, governmental regulation of such business is commonplace across jurisdictions.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"97. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. vs. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"". 27 wherein the Supreme Court has noted that the provisions of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act serve the dual objective of having copyright societies, i.e., to maintain a balance between the protection of owners' rights and interest of the public to have access to the works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"98. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the expansive words of Section 33(1), i.e., ""no person or association of persons shall commence or carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses""

clearly underline the intention of the legislature that business of 26 [(1984) 2 SCC 183] 27 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 56 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc issuing licenses can only be undertaken by a registered copyright society. These words are required to be construed in the context of its use in the Copyright Act and Rules which require that: (i) such business can be carried on only by a registered copyright society; (ii) such society is regulated by the Government; and (iii) there is only one society for one category of work. Thus, allowing PPL to carry on the business of licensing without registration would result in escaping the intended regulation and would be contrary to the scheme and object of Chapter VII of the Copyright Act.",,,,,,,
,,,,"99. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that if the Plaintiff's argument is accepted and an assignee/owner is permitted to carry on the business of issuing licenses without registration, then Section 33 itself would be rendered redundant and nugatory. This would be contrary to the clear intention of the legislature to regulate the business of licensing, even if the business is carried out by an assignee/owner. Since only an owner (which term includes an assignee) can issue licenses, it is quite obvious that the intent of Section 33(1) was to regulate owners of copyright who can potentially carry on the business of licensing. Thus, there is no logical basis in the Plaintiffs' argument that Section 33(1) applies to persons other than owners. He has submitted that the law intends that there must be a single copyright society for one class of work to ensure a single window for end-users.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"b. In ""Ameer Trading Corporation Ltd. vs. Shapoorji Data Processing Ltd"".29 the Supreme Court reiterated that the Heydon's Rule or Mischief Rule must be applied to suppress the mischief that was intended to be remedied, especially when Parliament has consciously made an amendment to the law.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"c. In ""S. Mohan Lal vs. R. Kondiah"" 30 it was held that the expressions used in the Act must take their colour from the context in which they appear.
",,,,,,,

In ""Badshah vs. Urmila Badshah Godse""31 the Supreme Court relied on the Heydon Rule to hold that courts must avoid a construction that ""would reduce the legislation to futility and should accept the bolder construction based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing an effective result"".

,,,,"101. In ""District Mining Officer vs. Tata Iron & Steel Co. & Anr.""32 the Supreme Court explained that legislation is primarily directed to the problems before the legislature and to cover similar problems arising in future. Thus, the legislative intent is to be derived by considering the words in the enactment "" in light of any discernable purpose or object which comprehends the mischief and its remedy to which the enactment is directed"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"102. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Chapter VII of the Copyright Act requires that the business of licensing be carried on in a particular manner. The Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to circumvent the entire regulatory regime and carry on the business of licensing in a manner other than what is prescribed by law. This would go against the well accepted rule laid down in ""Taylor vs Taylor Taylor"" 33 that if the law requires something to be done in a particular manner, it must be done only in that manner or not at all. He has referred to the decision of the ""Nazir Ahmad vs. The King- Emperor"" 34 and State of ""Uttar Pradesh vs. Singhara Singh"" 35, which follows the Taylor Rule.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"103. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the principles of construction propounded by PPL and Novex are misconceived and not applicable to instant case. He has submitted that the decisions relied upon by them in support of ""harmonious construction"" would 32 [(2001) 7 SCC 358] 33 [(1875) Vol.1Ch.D 426] 34 [1936 LXIII Indian Appeals 372] 35 [(1964) 4 SCR 485] varsha 59 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc require the court to read down Section 33(1) such that ""owners"" are excluded from the word ""persons"". This is contrary to the plain language used in Section 33(1) of the Act. Further, harmonious construction applies only if there is an ambiguity in the language of the statute and cannot be used if the language is clear. In the present case, the language of Section 33(1) is plain and unambiguous. Hence, it would be impermissible to ignore the rule of literal interpretation and apply the rule of ""harmonious construction""

instead.
104. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33(1) does not take away the general rights of owners to license their works. On the contrary, it retains and preserves that right but only regulates the manner in which the business of licensing is to be carried on. Thus, all that Section 33(1) requires is that if an owner wishes to carry on the business of licensing, he must do it in the legally mandated manner, i.e., through a registered copyright society.
105. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that PPL and Novex have relied upon the decisions in ""Union of India vs. Dileep Kumar Singh""36 to contend that the court must give precedence to the leading provision over the subordinate provision. However, this case too is inapplicable in the present situation. PPL and Novex have been unable to explain how Section 30 is a leading provision and Section 33 is a subordinate provision. On the contrary, the two operate in separate fields altogether.

In the instant case, there is no ambiguity in the language of Section 33(1). There is no absurdity or unintended consequence by adhering to the plain meaning of Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"107. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that constant refrain of PPL and Novex was that giving literal interpretation to Section 33(1) would lead to ""effacement"" of Section 30 and take away the right of an owner to monetise his copyright is completely incorrect.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"108. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that Section 33 does not take away an owner's right to license for commercial purposes. All that Section 33 postulates is that the business of licensing should be carried out in a regulated manner by registration under the Copyright Act. If an owner wishes to carry on business, he has to either be registered as a copyright society himself or must carry on the activity through a copyright society. Quite contrary to the Plaintiffs' submission, Section 33(1) would be effaced if the Plaintiffs' submissions are accepted. Since only an owner can issue licenses, exclusion of an owner from its purview would render Section 33(1) completely meaningless and redundant.

,,,,"iii) Person grants licenses in respect of his ""own works""; iv) the grant is ""consistent with his obligations as a member of the registered society"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"110. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in ""Dwarka Prasad vs. Dwarkadas Saraf"" 37 wherein it is held that a proviso does not travel beyond the main provision. Further, in ""Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited vs. Tarun Pal Singh and Ors"" 38 the Supreme Court went on to explain that a proviso cannot be interpreted as stating a general rule. He has submitted that there is nothing exceptional in the language or scheme of Section 33(1) or the first proviso to suggest that the proviso warrants a deviation from the general rule of interpretation. It cannot therefore be construed as creating an independent right in favour of the Plaintiff beyond the main enacting section.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"112. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that copyright societies are ""agencies"" or administrators of rights does not take that case any further. The decision of the Supreme Court's in ""Entertainment Network and Delhi High Court's decision in Lizard Lounge"" (Supra) relied upon by PPL and Novex in this context deal with the question whether business of licensing can be carried out by an owner without registration. Further, Section 33 requires a particular activity, i.e., business of licensing, to be done only by regulated entity/through a regulated entity.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"113. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the contention of PPL and Novex that the authorization granted to a copyright society can be withdrawn by an owner under Section 34(1)(b) would suggest that it is not mandatory for an owner to carry on business only 39 [(2008) 13 SCC 30] varsha 63 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc through a society ought to be rejected. All that Section 34(1)(b) says is that an owner is not perpetually bound to be a member of a copyright society and the section enables him to withdraw from a collective management system should he choose to. This is a voluntary act. Once he withdraws, he is in the same position as any other person who is not a member of a copyright society. He can exercise all rights under Section 14 and also issue a license under Section 30 in an individual capacity. But he cannot carry on the business of licensing. If he wishes to recommence the business of licensing, he has to once again join a registered copyright society.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"114. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that argument canvassed by PPL and Novex was that Section 31 provides for compulsory licensing. Thus, there is no need to regulate owners who carry on the business of licensing by requiring them to register as copyright societies is wholly fallacious and an incorrect reading of Section 31. Compulsory licensing is a completely different concept from regulation of the business of licensing carried on by copyright societies. He has submitted that Section 31 (1) (a) does not allow a user to challenge a Tarriff Scheme, whereas under Section 33 A this is allowed to a user. Further under Section 31, compulsory license can only be granted to a person whom the board/court finds ""qualified"" to receive a license. There is no such restriction under Section 33A. A decision for compulsory licensing under Section 31 creates a right in rem only in favour of the complainant/prospective licensee. On the other hand, an appeal under Section 33A results in modification of the Tariff Scheme for the public at large. Merely varsha 64 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc because the Copyright Act provides two remedies for two different scenarios, it cannot mean that one of the remedies available in law should be given a complete go-by to.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"118. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that the main section 33(1) and the First Proviso have been in the statute since the 1994 varsha 65 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc Amendments. The Second Proviso was brought in only in 2012. This is relevant because the 2012 Amendment Act also amended Section 18(1) and added provisos therein which prohibited authors of underlying works from assigning or waiving the right to receive royalties except to their legal heirs or copyright societies. Thus, it was necessary to make corresponding clarificatory changes to Section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"119. Dr. Tulzapurkar has placed reliance upon the decision of the Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications (P) Ltd. Vs DXC Technology (P) Ltd"". (Supra). He has submitted that the Madras High Court extensively considered all issues relating to Section 33 including the arguments raised by the Plaintiffs in the instant matter. He has submitted that the Madras High Court has correctly holds that Section 33 distinguishes between granting licenses in an individual capacity and carrying on the business of licensing. The Court holds that ""once the grant of license moves from the owner in his individual capacity and transcends into the realm of a business ""

Section 33(1) applies. On this basis, the Court concluded that since Novex was statutorily barred from issuing licenses, the very substratum for the relief sought by Novex must crumble like a pack of cards.",,,,,,,
,,,,"120. Dr. Tulzapurkar has submitted that this Court be pleased to answer the aforementioned issue in favour of Defendants and dismiss the Plaintiffs' Interim Applications.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"123. Mr. Narula has submitted that in interpreting any statute, the role of the Court is to give effect to the will of the legislature. Where ambiguities exist, the Courts, no doubt, have the power to take recourse to external and internal aids to construe a provision in line with the intention of the legislature. Having examined the background leading to the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012, in view of Section 33(1) and its second proviso, the business of granting or issuing licenses in respect of any work in which copyright subsists, can be undertaken only through a copyright society registered under Section 33(3) of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"124. Mr. Narula has submitted that the second Proviso to Section 33(1) and proviso to Section 33 (3A), being the consequence and effect of the amendments to Section 17, 18 and 19 read with Section 30A, provides that the business of issuing or granting licence (being collection and distribution) of sound recording or cinematograph film, which comprises of the non- assignable and non-waivable rights in literary and musical work ""shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under this Act"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"130. Mr. Shenoy has submitted that Section 33(1) of the Copyright Act provides that no person or association of persons shall ""commence or, carry on the business of issuing or granting licenses"". It is necessary for this Court to give meaning to what is meant by the ""business of issuing or granting licenses"".He has submitted that these words are used by the Legislature to mean the ""Collective Administration of Copyright"". The same is borne out of the varsha 70 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc statement and objects and reasons of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1992 as well as Clause 11 of Notes on Clause. Further, the title/ heading of Chapter VII is ""Copyright Societies"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"132. Having considered the submissions, for determining the issue that arises in the above suits viz. whether the plaintiff is entitled to seek reliefs sought for in the plaint without being registered as a copyright society under section 33(1) of the Act, it would be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act. In the present case, that PPL and Novex have been partially assigned the copyright under the Sound Recording Agreements i.e. to communicate the sound recordings to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"133. Section 14 of the Act defines a copyright to mean the exclusive right to reproduce a literary, dramatic or musical work in any material form including storing by electronic means; to make copies of such a work; to perform it in public and in the case of a sound recording it includes the right to sell or give on commercial rentals or to communicate the sound recording to the public. Further, 'Owner' of Copyright is provided in Chapter IV of the Act. As submitted by Mr. Khambata, Ownership of copyright can be acquired in 4 broad ways including through an assignment under Sections 18 & 19 of the Act which is relevant in the present case. These confer varsha 71 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc full and absolute ownership on the author/owner/assignee, as the case may be.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"134. Further Section 18(2) of the Act provides as under :

""where the assignee of a copyright becomes entitled to any right comprised in the copyright, the assignee as respects the rights so assigned, and the assignor as respects the rights not assigned, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner of copyright and the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"135. Whereas Section 18 (1) of the Act specifically recognizes the owner's right to assign his copyright either wholly or partially, to any person. This is a substantive right which has been provided to an owner under the Act and can be exercised without restrictions except as provided in the section.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"136. Thus, in my view a partial assignment created as in the present case in favour of PPL and Novex i.e. to communicate sound recording to the public, to the extent of the right so created, the assignee is an 'owner' of the copyright in the work.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"137. PPL and Novex as assignees/owners of copyright license their work under section 30 of the Act. This Section falls under Chapter VI of the Act and reads as under:

""30. Licences by owners of copyright.:-The owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by licence in writing by him or by his duly authorised agent:
Provided that in the case of a licence relating to copyright in any future work, the licence shall take effect only when the work comes into existence.
Explanation.-- Where a person to whom a licence relating to copyright in any future work is granted under this section dies before the work comes into existence, his legal representatives shall, in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the licence, be entitled to the benefit of the licence"".",,,,,,,
,,,,"138. Thus, Section 30 of the Act is the source, which gives an ""owner"" of a copyright who may be an assignee, the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license. Further, Section 30 also specifically empowers a ""duly authorized agent"" of the varsha 73 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owner, to grant license. Thus, it follows that PPL and Novex as owners/assignees have the power to grant any interest in the copyright by license which would include the interest of communicating the sound recordings to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"139. Now turning to the scope and object of the 1994 Amendment which added Chapter VII and in particular sections 33 to 36 in the Act. Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses reads as follows:

""This clause seeks to substitute new provisions for Chapter VII to make provision for copyright societies in respect of any kind of right (and not merely ""performer's rights"") and to make adequate general provision for the registration and management of such societies in the interests both of authors and of other copyright owners for whom it would be impractical or uneconomical to licence the use of their work individually to all users,...""",,,,,,,
,,,,"140. Thus, from a reading of Clause 11 of the Notes on Clauses Sections 33 to 36 have been introduced as part of Chapter VII for promoting the collective administration of rights through copyright societies, both for the benefit of the owner as well as the general public. These societies, on an ""authorization"" from the varsha 74 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc owners could administer rights that were either licensed and/or assigned to them. A copyright Society fundamentally operates to administer rights in respect of works that belong to ""others"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"141. In my view, by its very nature, a copyright society may wear two hats i.e. (i) as an authorized agent and (ii) as an assignee. It administers the rights of ""owners"" by operating as an agent. It is necessary to note that under section 34 of the Act and in particular Section 34 (1) (b) it is provided that an owner will have the right to withdraw authorization given to the copyright society. This also shows that an author or other owner/assignee does not have to carry on the business of licensing his works only through a copyright society. Since, once an owner withdraws its authorization from a copyright society, the owner can independently exercise his rights under Section 30 of the Act to grant licenses as he deems appropriate. It could never have been the intention of the legislature that once an author/owner withdraws the authorization from a copyright society then that work cannot be licensed by anyone especially an owner. Such an interpretation would undermine the public interest in making available the copyrighted work to members of the public. In any event the provisions of Section 31, 31A-D would continue to operate to bind all owners to grant compulsory and statutory licenses even after withdrawal of authorization under Section 34(1)(b).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"142. Thus it is clear that the 1994 Amendment which introduced these provisions was brought in to protect and facilitate varsha 75 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc the exercise of ""owner's"" rights, not to restrict or diminish them in any way.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"143. The other relevant provision namely Section 34(3) of the Act clarifies that a copyright society is licensing the works of an ""owner"" under section 30. This means that a copyright society is licensing the works of the ""owner"" as a duly authorized agent under Section 30. Therefore, this is not a new right created in favour of a copyright society independent of the owner or independent of it being a duly authorized agent. Section 35(1) of the Act provides that ""Every copyright society shall be subject to the collective control of the owners of rights under this Act whose rights it administers ..."". Thus, both Sections 34 and 35 draw a clear distinction between the author/ owner of the right on the one hand and the administrator of that right on the other (i.e. the copyright society).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"144. The decision relied upon by Mr. Khambata on behalf of Novex namely ""Entertainment Network India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd"" (Supra) is apposite. The Supreme Court has held that Chapter VII was incorporated into the Act so as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property through a Copyright Society. The Supreme Court holds that as per the Section 34 of the Act, a Copyright Society is a virtual agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Paragraph 66 of the said decision reads as under:

""66. ...It may, however, be of some importance to note that Chapter VII deals with Copyright society, the concept whereof was incorporated in the Act so varsha 76 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc as to enable an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property by a widespread dispersal in a regulated manner. It for all intent and purport steps into the shoes of the author. The society grants license on behalf of the author, it files litigation on his behalf, both for the purpose of enforcement as also protection of the enforcement of his right. It not only pays royalty to the author but is entitled to distribute the amount collected by it amongst its members. Section 34 providing for administration of rights of owners by a copyright society for all intent and purport creates a virtual agency so as to enable the society to act on behalf of the owner..."".",,,,,,,
,,,,"146. This is further made clear by Delhi High Court in ""Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs Lizard Lounge & Ors"". (supra) which has also been relied upon by Mr. Khambata on behalf of Novex. The Delhi High Court has held thus:

""the owner continues to simultaneously have rights to deal with his Copyright in the work...
varsha                                                                           77 of 87




 Varsha                                                  COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc


25.....The Copyright Society is an agent appointed under the agreement by the owner of the Copyright and specific powers have been conferred on the agent to institute legal proceedings. However, this does not denuding the author of its own individual rights"".
",,,,,,,
,,,,"147. The function of a Copyright Society has been highlighted by Copinger at Page 1540 which has been relied upon by Mr. Khambata for Novex, wherein copyright society is referred to as a collecting society. Collecting societies provide a service to enable rights owners to enforce and administer certain of their copyrights effectively and cheaply, and secondly to provide a service to users by facilitating access to copyright works and making it possible for users to comply with their obligations under the law to obtain licences for the use of copyright works. Advantages of collecting societies has also been mentioned. Collecting societies are practically, economically and legally both viable and essential: Practically, because copyright owners cannot be in an indefinite number of places at the same time exercising individual rights. Further, ""collecting administration bodies provide the best available mechanism for licensing and administering copyrights and is to be encouraged wherever individual licensing is not practicable. They represent the best means of protecting the rights owners' interests"", enabling copyright owners to license and monitor the use of their works, to collect and distribute together and to bring varsha 78 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc actions for infringement. At the same time, they facilitate access to copyright protected works for the consumer and minimize the number of persons with whom users must negotiate licensing contracts.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"148. I am of the considered view that Section 33 (1) of the Act cannot curtail the power of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license under Section 30 of the Act. This provision has not at all being denuded by the 1994 Amendment, which has brought in Chapter VII in the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"149. I do not find any merit in the interpretation placed by the Defendant that ""no person"" in Section 33(1) includes an ""owner"" of copyright and therefore even an ""owner"" of copyright cannot commence or carry on the business of granting copyright licenses. If such interpretation is accepted, Section 33(1) of the Act would take way the power of owner and / or the right of the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license. This would emasculate right of the owner under Section 30. This was not contemplated by the Parliament by way of the 1994 Amendment Act. In my view, Chapter VII which deals with copyright society is operating in a different field than that of Chapter VI which is the source for granting of licenses by the owner of copyright.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"150. It is a settled rule of Interpretation that two apparently conflicting provisions operating in two different fields should be reconciled by restricting each to its own object varsha 79 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc or subject. This has been expressly held by Supreme Court in ""K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay"" 41. I find much merit in the interpretation placed by counsel on behalf of PPL and Novex that the prohibition as contemplated under Section 33(1) is on carrying on business of licensing by a person or association of persons in its own name for works in which ""others"". hold copyright. This has also held by this Court in Leopold Cafe and Stores and Anr. (supra). Thus in other words carry on ""business' of granting licenses can be authorised to an agent such as a copyright society under Section 30 read with Section 18, 19 and 34 of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"151. Further, the heading of Section 33 is ""Registration of copyright society"" and which could only mean that where a copyright society wants to carry on the business of issuing licenses on behalf of ""others"", then it must do so as per the provisions of Section 33. This is all that the section contemplates. It cannot purport to curtail the owner's right to license given under Section 30 falling in Chapter VI of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"152. The Interpretation placed on ""business"" in Section 33(1) of the Act by learned counsel on behalf of the Defendants by referring to Rule 2(c) of the Copyright Rules, 2013 which defines 'Copyright Business' is in my view misconceived. This definition is in wide terms although it also references sub- section (3) of Section 34, which deals with functions that a copyright society may perform qua works of others. However, if 41 AIR 1961 SC 112 (Para 77(1)) (Sr. No. 41/ Page 737, Volume IV of Defendant's Compilation).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"the term ""business"" is given the wide meaning, then, there would necessarily be a conflict between Sections 30 and 33 of the Act. The definition in Rule 2(c) in any event applies only to the rules and it cannot be applied to interpret Section 33(1), a provision of the primary statute and one that came 19 years before Rule 2(c). Further, the Rules are a piece of subordinate legislation. They cannot be considered to control the provisions of the Act especially if they cause conflict or absurdity in reading of the substantive provision of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"153. Much has been said by the counsel for the Defendants that Section 33 of the Act is a later provision and prevails over Section 30 of the Act. I find in ""K.M. Nanavati' (supra), the Supreme Court has treated the rule of the later provision as one amongst a basket of rules which must operate together with other rules and which moderate and temper each other. Further, the Supreme Court has held that if there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute then it has to be determined which is the leading provision and which is the subordinate provision and which provision must give way to the other. I find that from the two provision viz. Sections 30 and 33(1) of the Act, Section 30 is the leading provision which is the source of power i.e. licensing rights conferred rights upon an owner . Section 33(1) does not deal with owner's right of licensing.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"154. Although, there have been arguments on the First Proviso and Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act as well as reference to the legislation of 2012 Act as well as parliamentary debates and Speeches on this legislation, these provisos are inapplicable to the present case. The Second Proviso is confined to authors of underlying works which requires protection and thus inapplicable to the present case which concerns the owner of sound recordings. The Second Proviso to Section 33(1) in fact militates against the interpretation sought to be propounded on behalf of the Defendants. By amending section 33(1) in 2012 i.e. by adding the second proviso it would show that the Parliament itself did not contemplate that Section 33(1) barred every owner of a copyright from carrying on the business of licensing his works. Thus, the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings shall be carried out only through a copyright society duly registered under the Act. Hence, it cannot be accepted that the Second Proviso to Section 33(1) of the Act is clarificatory.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"155. The Madras High Court in ""Novex Communications vs DXC Technology Pvt Ltd"". (supra) has in my view overlooked Section 30 of the Act where the owner has a right to grant any interest in the copyright by way of license. The Madras High Court has applied the second proviso of section 33(1) of the Act to the right to communicate the sound recordings to the public, although such right does not fall within that proviso. The second varsha 82 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc proviso as mentioned is confined to underlying works. Further, the Madras High Court has held that Novex is not entitled to issue licenses which according to the Court falls into the second proviso after considering legislative history and speeches in parliament. However, no reason has been provided as to how the licenses in respect of sound recording is covered by the second proviso to section 33(1).
",,,,,,,
,,,,"156. Thus in my view the Madras High Court has not considered Section 33(1) in light of other provisions of the Act namely Section 30 read with Section 18 and 30 of the Act which enables the Plaintiff- Novex as owner to grant licenses to the public.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"157. In my considered view carrying on business of granting licences cannot be excluded from section 30 of the Act, particularly when such granting of licenses is by the owner of the copyright. The word ""business"" would include the grant of Licenses. If the interpretation of the Defendants on business is to be accepted then in that case 99% of the ownership rights would be taken away and the only right left with the owners would be to license its rights for philanthropy. Thus, this interpretation of the Defendant cannot be accepted.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"158. The decisions on business relied upon by the Counsel on both sides only support the above view.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"159. The first proviso of Section 33(1) of the Act only recognizes the right of an owner to grant licenses even after such owner becomes a member of a registered Copyright Society. The first proviso has nothing to do with granting of Licenses by an owner of copyright under section 30 of the Act. If a member of the copyright society can grant license surely a non-member cannot be prevented from licensing his own works. Thus, the first proviso to Section 33(1) cannot in any manner prevent a non member from exercising his rights under Section 30 of the Act.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"160. It appears from the argument of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that a distinction has been drawn between the granting of individual licenses by the owner and the carrying on of business of granting licenses by the owner which makes section 33 (1) applicable. I find no merit in this argument, particularly in view of aforementioned findings that Section 30 of the Act confers the power on the owner to grant any interest in the copyright by license which in my view would encompass an owner carrying on business of granting licenses in respect of works in which he has copyright. Thus, there would be no fetter on the owners rights under Section 30 of the Act by Section 33(1) of the Act which falls under a separate chapter. Thus, in my view it is not necessary for PPL and Novex as owners/assignees of copyright to be registered as copyright societies for carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"161. Merely because PPL was at one time registered as a copyright society will make no difference to the above findings as PPL is granting Licenses as an owner and thus entitled under Section 30 of the Act to grant its interest in the copyright by license. Further, it will not make any difference that Novex is carrying on the business of granting licenses of their works as there is no restriction placed on an owner to grant any interest in the copyright by License. Thus, in my view the power under Section 30 to grant license by an owner has in no manner been denuded by section 33(1) of the Act. Accordingly, PPL and Novex as owners of copyright in respect of their works are entitled to file the present suits and seek reliefs sought for therein.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"162. The above findings will also apply to those Suits where PPL and /or Novex are exclusive Licensees as Section 54 of the copyright Act, provides that an 'owner of copyright' includes an 'exclusive licensee'.
",,,,,,,
,,,,"163. I further find no merit in the submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar on behalf of Defendant that the cause of action in the above suits is on an illegal act or amounts to transgression of a positive law as the plaintiffs have been generally assigned the business of granting licenses which activity they seek protection without having themselves registered as copyright society and thus violative of the statutory protection in Section 33(1) of the Act. The decisions relied upon on the well settled principle of of varsha 85 of 87 Varsha COMP-264-2022 AND COMP-363-2019 final.doc ex turpi causa non oritur actio or ex dolo malo non oritur actio are inapplicable in the present case. This is in view of my finding that PPL and Novex have the power as owners to grant interest in the copyright by license under section 30 of the Act irrespective of whether they are carrying on the business of granting licenses or not. Further, there is no bar under section 33(1) of the Act from an owner carrying on the business of licensing, or collecting license fees. Accordingly, I do not find that the Assignment Agreements and/or Exclusive License Agreements are illegal as contended on behalf of Defendants.
